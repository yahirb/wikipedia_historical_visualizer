{"Green_Bay": {"Renard Isle": "Renard Isle is a man-made island, or confined disposal facility (CDF) in the lower Green Bay, just northeast of the mouth of the Fox River (Wisconsin). Formerly called Kidney Island, it is 55 acres constructed in 1977 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a disposal site for dredged materials taken from the Fox River and Green Bay harbor entrance channel. The dredged material is contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) that are known probable carcinogens to humans, as well as large amounts of furans, dioxins, mercury, lead, pentachlorophenol, and hundreds of other persistent toxic chemicals which cause serious health concerns for fish, wildlife, and humans."}}
