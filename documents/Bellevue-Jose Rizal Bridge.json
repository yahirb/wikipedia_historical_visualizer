{"Bellevue": {"Jose Rizal Bridge": "The Jose Rizal Bridge carries 12th Avenue South over South Dearborn Street and Interstate 90 in Seattle, connecting the International District to Beacon Hill. Built in 1911, and originally called the 12th Avenue South Bridge or the Dearborn Street Bridge, it was one of the first permanent steel bridges in Seattle. It was renamed in honor of the Filipino patriot Jos\u00e9 Rizal in 1974, though the official name is not well known by Seattleites."}}
