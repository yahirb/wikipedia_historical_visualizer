{"New_York": {"Bennett Building (New York City)": "The Bennett Building at 93-99 Nassau Street, or 139 Fulton Street, between Fulton and Ann Streets in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City is a ten-story plus penthouse cast-iron loft building. It was commissioned by James Gordon Bennett Jr., the publisher of the New York Herald newspaper, and designed by Arthur D. Gilman in the French Second Empire style, the architect's only existing work in New York City. The building's three fully designed facades face Fulton, Nassau, and Ann Streets. Constructed in 1872-73 at six stories, the mansard roof was removed and three floors and a penthouse were added in 1890-92 by James M. Farnsworth for the building's new owner, John Petit. In 1894, Farnsworth constructed an extension of the building to Ann Street. In both cases, Farnsworth's additions carefully followed Gilman's original design. The Bennett Building is the tallest building in the world with an entirely cast-iron facade.\nOn November 21, 1995, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a New York City landmark."}}
