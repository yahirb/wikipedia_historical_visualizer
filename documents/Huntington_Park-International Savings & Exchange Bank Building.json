Standing ten floors, it was designed in the Renaissance Revival and Italianate styles by architect H. Alban Reaves (some sources spell Reeves), who had previously designed several structures in New York, including what is now the south building of the historic Schuyler Arms.\nIt stood at 226 North Spring Street, the intersection of Temple and Spring (sometimes referred to as Temple Square) across from the Main Post Office, and was featured in several postcards from the 1920s."}}
