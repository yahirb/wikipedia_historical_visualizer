{"Cincinnati": {"English Woods, Cincinnati": "English Woods is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nIn 2005, the housing projects which occupied a large portion of the area of English Woods were largely demolished after renovation was calculated to be prohibitively expensive while local HUD, city leaders, and residents failed to come up with a workable redevelopment plan. The population was 405 at the 2010 census."}}
