{"Berkeley": {"Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge": "The eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge was a construction project to replace a seismically unsound portion of the Bay Bridge with a new self-anchored suspension bridge (SAS) and a pair of viaducts. The bridge is in the U.S. state of California and crosses the San Francisco Bay between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland. It was built between 2002 and 2013 and does not have a name other than the unofficial name of the bridge as a whole (\"San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge\")."}}
