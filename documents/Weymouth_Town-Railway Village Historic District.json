{"Weymouth_Town": {"Railway Village Historic District": "The Railway Village Historic District is a historic district encompassing a densely populated, predominantly residential, area of eastern Milton, Massachusetts. The 30-acre (12 ha) district lies roughly between East Milton Square and the town line with neighboring Quincy. The area's significant growth occurred after the 1826 construction of the Granite Railway, which transported stone from the nearby granite quarries to the Neponset River."}}
