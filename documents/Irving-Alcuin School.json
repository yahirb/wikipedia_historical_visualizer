He was made Abbot of Tours in 796, where he remained until his death. \"The most learned man anywhere to be found\", according to Einhard's Life of Charlemagne (ca. 817-833), he is considered among the most important architects of the Carolingian Renaissance. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era."}}
