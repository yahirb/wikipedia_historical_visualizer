{"Pittsburgh": {"J&L Tunnel": "J&L Tunnel is a tunnel on CSX Transportation's Pittsburgh Subdivision, at the former location of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company (now the SouthSide Works).\nThe tunnel was used to allow trains on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad to bypass the Jones and Laughlin steel mill, by passing under it.\nStarting in 2011, work was performed, as part of CSX Transportation's National Gateway project, to raise the clearance inside the tunnel, allowing double-stacked container trains to pass through the tunnel."}}
