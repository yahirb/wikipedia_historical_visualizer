{"Clifton": {"Schuyler Copper Mine": "The Schuyler Copper Mine is an abandoned, historic copper mine located in what is now North Arlington in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. Operations began in 1715, making it the earliest copper mine in New Jersey and one of the oldest in the United States. In 1755, it was the site of the first use of a steam engine assembled in America."}}
