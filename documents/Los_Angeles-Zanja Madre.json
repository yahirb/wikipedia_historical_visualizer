{"Los_Angeles": {"Zanja Madre": "The Zanja Madre (English: \"Mother Ditch\") is the original aqueduct that brought water to the Pueblo de Los Angeles from the R\u00edo Porciuncula (Los Angeles River). The original open, earthen ditch was completed by community laborers within a month of founding the pueblo. This water system was used for both domestic uses and irrigation to fields west of town."}}
