{"Honolulu": {"Kakaako Waterfront Park": "Kaka'ako Waterfront Park, also known as \"Point Panic Park\", is a free public park in Kaka'ako, south of downtown Honolulu, just off Ala Moana Boulevard at the end of Cooke Street. It was opened in November 1992 on the site of a former municipal landfill and consists of 35 acres (140,000 m2) of grass-covered rolling hills adjacent to the ocean. There is no sandy beach at this location, and access to the ocean is by concrete stairs."}}
