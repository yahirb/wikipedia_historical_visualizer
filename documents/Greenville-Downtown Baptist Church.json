{"Greenville": {"Downtown Baptist Church": "Downtown Baptist Church, is a historic church building located at 101 W. McBee Avenue in Greenville, South Carolina. It was constructed in 1858 as the new home of First Baptist Church of Greenville, replacing an earlier structure on the banks of the Reedy River. The congregation of First Baptist Church vacated the site for a new campus on Cleveland Street in the late 1970s at which time a minority of the congregation elected to remain at the downtown site and start a new church under the name Downtown Baptist Church."}}
