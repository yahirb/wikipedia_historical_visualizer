{"Taunton": {"Albert Field Tack Company": "The Albert Field Tack Company is a historic industrial site located at 19 Spring Street in Taunton, Massachusetts, next to the Mill River. Built in 1868 for a company founded in the 1820s to manufacture fasteners (tacks and nails), the main office building is an unusually high-style building given its industrial setting. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984."}}
