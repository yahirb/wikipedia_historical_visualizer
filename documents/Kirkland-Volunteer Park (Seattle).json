Colman. In 1885 it was designated a cemetery, but two years later it was named \"Lake View Park,\" and Lake View Cemetery was developed on an adjacent plot of land. The park then became known as \"City Park.\" In 1901, it was renamed \"Volunteer Park\" to honor the volunteers who served in the Spanish\u2013American War."}}
