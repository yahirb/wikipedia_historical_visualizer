{"Spokane_Valley": {"Dishman Hills": "Dishman Hills Natural Resources Conservation Area is a 530-acre (210 ha) area protected by a combination of public and non-profit groups (Spokane County Parks and Recreation Department, Washington Department of Natural Resources, and Dishman Hills Natural Area Association), located in Spokane County, Washington. The granite outcroppings, forming the bulk of the area, were originally formed 70 million years ago, by volcanic magma pushing up through the Earth's crust and then cooling. The current state of the rock was formed between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago by the Missoula Floods."}}
