{"Cambridge": {"Kerry Quarter": "Kerry Quarter in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States also called the Lower Marsh, was reclaimed from the Charles River during the construction of the Harvard River Dormitories. In a deal with the city of Cambridge, Harvard sold much of the reclaimed land along Putnam Ave to parishioners of St. Paul's Church in nearby Harvard Square."}}
