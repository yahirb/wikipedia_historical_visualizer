{"Bristol": {"Hart's Corner Historic District": "The Hart's Corner Historic District encompasses a microcosm of 19th-century agricultural history in southeastern Burlington, Connecticut. Set at the corner of Stafford and Monce Roads are three farmsteads, dating in age from the 1790s to 1874, all of which are well-preserved specimens of their style. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987."}}
