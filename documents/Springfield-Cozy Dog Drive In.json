{"Springfield": {"Cozy Dog Drive In": "The Cozy Dog Drive In is a restaurant located at 2935 South Sixth Street in Springfield, Illinois\nThe crusty curs which were hot dogs coated in a corn meal batter, were sold at the USO club and at the base PX by Ed Waldmire. Upon returning to Springfield, Ed's wife, Virginia, stated that \"crusty cur\" was not a good name for regular civilians. Together, they decided upon the name \"Cozy Dog,\" and Virginia created the original logo of two hot dogs in a loving embrace."}}
