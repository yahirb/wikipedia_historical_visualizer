{"Toledo": {"Propylaea (sculpture)": "A propylaea, propylea or propylaia (; Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1) is any monumental gateway in ancient Greek architecture. The prototypical Greek example is the propylaea that serves as the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. The Greek Revival Brandenburg Gate of Berlin and the Propylaea in Munich both evoke the central portion of the Athens propylaea."}}
