{"Portland": {"Casco Bay Bridge": "The Casco Bay Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Fore River, connecting South Portland and Portland, Maine, United States. The bridge carries four lanes (two in each direction) of State Route 77, a bike lane in each direction, and a pedestrian sidewalk on the east side of the span.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987 the state of Maine, in concert with surrounding towns, concluded that the existing Million Dollar Bridge, which was almost 70 years old, was inadequate for current needs."}}
