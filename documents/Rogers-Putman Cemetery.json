{"Rogers": {"Putman Cemetery": "The Putnam Cemetery is a historic cemetery on SE Metro Parkway, just south of Walton Boulevard, in Bentonville, Arkansas. Now completely surrounded by commercial development, this small cemetery (less than 0.5 acres (0.20 ha)) is ringed by an iron fence with an arch identifying it, and is located just behind hotels that front on Walton Boulevard. The cemetery was established in 1860, and was the family burial ground of the Putnam family, who were some of Benton County's earliest settlers."}}
