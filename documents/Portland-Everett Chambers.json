{"Portland": {"Everett Chambers": "The Everett Chambers or Hotel Everett is an historic mixed-use commercial and residential building at 47-55 Oak Street in Downtown Portland, Maine. Built in 1902 to a design by local architect Frederick Tompson, it is an important surviving example of a lodging house (in which meals are not provided), built early in the transition period from the 19th century boarding house (in which meals were provided by the proprietor) to more modern 20th-century transient accommodations. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004."}}
