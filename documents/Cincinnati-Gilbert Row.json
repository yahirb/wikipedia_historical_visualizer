{"Cincinnati": {"Gilbert Row": "The Gilbert Row is a group of historic rowhouses in the southern part of the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Composed of six individual small houses and a more substantial structure designed as a commercial building, the row was built by the real estate firm of Thomas Emery's Sons according to a design by the Steinkamp Brothers architectural firm. Built in 1889, the complex became a model for many residential complexes constructed by Thomas Emery's Sons during the 1890s, including multiple apartment-style properties in Walnut Hills."}}
