{"New_York": {"Morse Building": "The Morse Building, also known as the Nassau-Beekman Building, is a high-rise building located in Manhattan, New York City. The Morse Building was one of the world's first prismatically shaped skyscrapers and, at 140 feet, one of the tallest buildings in New York when built. Its sheer walls and flat roof were a departure from designs of previous buildings topped by step-backs, mansard roofs, or towers. It was developed by G. Livingston and Sidney E. Morse, nephews of telegraph inventor Samuel F. B. Morse. The building was designated a New York City landmark in September, 2006."}}
