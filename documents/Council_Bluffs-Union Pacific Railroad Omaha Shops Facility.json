{"Council_Bluffs": {"Union Pacific Railroad Omaha Shops Facility": "The Union Pacific Railroad Omaha Shops Facility was a 100-acre (0.40 km2) shop for the trains of the Union Pacific located at North 9th and Webster in Downtown Omaha. With the first locomotives arriving in 1865, it took until the 1950s for the facility to become the major overhaul and maintenance facility for the railroad. This lasted until 1988 when UP moved most of the operations out-of-state."}}
