{"St._Charles": {"Historic Aircraft Restoration Museum": "The Historic Aircraft Restoration Museum, located at Creve Coeur Airport in Maryland Heights, Missouri, USA is a museum dedicated to restoring and preserving historical aircraft. The airplanes in the collection are all fabric-covered, and most are biplanes from the inter-war years (the \"Golden age of flight\"). The museum's volunteers maintain most of these aircraft in full working order and this is one of the largest collections of flying classic aircraft in America."}}
