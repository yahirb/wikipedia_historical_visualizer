{"Baltimore": {"1840s Carrollton Inn": "The 1840s Carrollton Inn and Plaza, located in Baltimore, Maryland consists of two historic buildings and their complementary 1980 additions built to resemble the previous federal style buildings. The oldest of the row house buildings dates back to the late 18th century and anchors the east side of the block containing the Carroll Mansion (not part of the inn), the winter home of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, signer of the Declaration of Independence. These buildings and others were assembled by the City of Baltimore in the 1980s and became the Baltimore City Life Museums until its closure in 1997 due to financial issues."}}
