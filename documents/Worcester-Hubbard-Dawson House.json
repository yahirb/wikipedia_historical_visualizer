{"Worcester": {"Hubbard-Dawson House": "The Hubbard-Dawson House is a historic house at 925 Main Street in Holden, Massachusetts. This rambling 2.5 story wood frame house is the only surviving instance of Colonial Revival and Queen Anne styling in Holden. The central portion of the house is fairly old, and may date to 1832, when a house was known to be standing on the property."}}
