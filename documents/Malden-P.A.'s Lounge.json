{"Malden": {"P.A.'s Lounge": "P.A.'s Lounge is a live music venue in Somerville, Massachusetts, located near Union Square at 345 Somerville Ave. The venue's name derives from its original popularity as a club frequented by Portuguese immigrants (the letters P and A standing for Portuguese-American). P.A.'s then became a Portuguese seafood restaurant before re-opening as a live music venue and bar in the fall of 2002."}}
