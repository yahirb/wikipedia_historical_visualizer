{"Cleveland": {"Rockefeller Park": "Rockefeller Park is a city park named in honor of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller Sr., located in Cleveland, Ohio. Part of the Cleveland Public Parks District, Rockefeller Park is immediately adjacent Wade Park to the southeast, and across Euclid Ave on its northwest border. Besides the distinction of being the largest park located completely within city limits, Rockefeller Park is a link in a chain of parkland that connects the heights region of the eastern suburbs to the city's lakefront."}}
