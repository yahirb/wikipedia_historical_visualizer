{"Portland": {"James Beard Public Market": "The James Beard Public Market is a proposed public market in Portland, Oregon. It is named after James Beard, a Portland-born chef and cookbook writer. The market was planned to be located at the west end of the Morrison Bridge in downtown Portland, in what are currently parking lots, but this site was dropped in November 2016 after concerns over pedestrian accessibility due to the bridgehead ramps."}}
