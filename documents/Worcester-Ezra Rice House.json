{"Worcester": {"Ezra Rice House": "The Ezra Rice House is a historic house at 1133 W. Boylston Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The \u200b2 1\u20442-story wood-frame house was built sometime between 1833 and 1845, and was a rare local example of transitional Federal and Greek Revival styling. Its front entry was virtually identical to that of the Charles Newton House, and is derived from examples published by Asher Benjamin in 1830."}}
