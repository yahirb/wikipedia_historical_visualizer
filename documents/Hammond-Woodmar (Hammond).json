{"Hammond": {"Woodmar (Hammond)": "Woodmar is a neighborhood in southeast Hammond, Indiana, approximately between Columbia and Kennedy Avenues. It is bounded to the east by Hessville, to the west by South Hammond, to the north by industrial land along United States Route 20, and to the south by the town of Highland. The neighborhood's boundaries correspond to Hammond's Planning District V.\n\nDominated by large single-family homes, Woodmar was largely built in the 1920s, with the goal of allowing the Calumet Region's wealthier residents to get \"out of the smoke zone and into the ozone.\" In these early years, Woodmar was considered more exclusive than most Hammond neighborhoods."}}
