The ranch, located north of what eventually became the city of Glendale, Arizona, was rich in figs and other fruit orchards, vineyards, and fields of alfalfa. The ranch has all of its historical structures restored, and the \"Sahuaro Ranch Park\" is administered by the Parks and Recreation Department of Glendale."}}
