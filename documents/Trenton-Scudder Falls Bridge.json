{"Trenton": {"Scudder Falls Bridge": "The Scudder Falls Bridge is a plate girder bridge that carries Interstate 95 over the Delaware River, connecting Lower Makefield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with the Scudders Falls section of Ewing Township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. This bridge, which was constructed from 1958 to 1959, is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, but currently is toll-free. This bridge is the southernmost freeway-standard bridge over the Delaware River that requires no tolls for vehicular traffic in either direction."}}
