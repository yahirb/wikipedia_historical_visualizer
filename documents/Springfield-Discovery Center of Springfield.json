{"Springfield": {"Discovery Center of Springfield": "The Discovery Center of Springfield in Springfield, Missouri, is an interactive hands-on museum committed to inspiring people of all ages with a lifelong love of learning and an appreciation of the world and our place in it. Its history goes back to the late 1980s when a group of community volunteers led by the junior league of Springfield began a feasibility study for a children's hands-on museum project for Springfield and the Ozark region. It was determined that a hands-on museum could provide a unique learning environment that would help cultivate children's curiosity and imagination, confidence, communication, interaction and interpretive skills."}}
