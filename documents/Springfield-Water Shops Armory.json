{"Springfield": {"Water Shops Armory": "The Water Shops Armory, located at 1 Allen Street, was a part of the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nThe main armory stretched over two city blocks in what was known as the Hill Shops (where the National Historic Site now is accompanied by the Springfield Technical Community College which occupies most of the 22 original buildings). About one mile (1.6 km) south, on the Mill River, the United States Army built the Water Shops where the heavy metal forging and machining was done as well as gun stock shaping."}}
