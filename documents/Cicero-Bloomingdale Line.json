{"Cicero": {"Bloomingdale Line": "The Bloomingdale Line was a 2.7-mile (4.3 km) elevated railroad running east-west on the northwest side of Chicago. In 2015, the City of Chicago converted it into an elevated greenway called The Bloomingdale Trail, which forms the backbone of the larger parks and trail network called The 606. This linear, elevated park passes through the community areas of Logan Square, Humboldt Park, and West Town."}}
