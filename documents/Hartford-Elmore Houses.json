{"Hartford": {"Elmore Houses": "The Elmore Houses are a pair of historic farmhouses at 78 and 87 Long Hill Road in South Windsor, Connecticut. The two houses, one built before 1819 and restyled in the 1840s, and the other one built new in the 1840s, are locally important rural examples of Greek Revival architecture. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985."}}
