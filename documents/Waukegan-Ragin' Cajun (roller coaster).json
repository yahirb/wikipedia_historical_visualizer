{"Waukegan": {"Ragin' Cajun (roller coaster)": "Ragin' Cajun is a steel mouse roller coaster at Six Flags America in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Manufactured by Zamperla and Reverchon Industries, the design is a \"Crazy Mouse\", which is similar to a \"Wild Mouse.\" Crazy Mouse coasters' cars freely spin during the second half of the ride, but Wild Mouse coasters' cars do not. The ride runs five cars at a time, and each car holds up to four riders with a maximum of three adults."}}
