{"Richmond": {"Southampton Shoal Light": "Southampton Shoal is a former lighthouse site in California, United States. A platform sits at the southwest edge of Southampton Shoals, northeast of Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. The platform is all that remains of the original structure and supports an automated bell which chimes every ten seconds and red light mounted on a pole, which flashes on for three seconds and is then dark for 3 seconds in each six second cycle (Iso R 6s)."}}
