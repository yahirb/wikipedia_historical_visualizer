{"Daly_City": {"The Little Shamrock": "A shamrock is a young sprig, used as a symbol of Ireland. Saint Patrick, Ireland's patron saint, is said to have used it as a metaphor for the Christian Holy Trinity. The name shamrock comes from Irish seamr\u00f3g [\u02c8\u0283am\u02e0\u027e\u02e0o\u02d0\u0261], which is the diminutive of the Irish word for plant (seamair) and means simply \"little plant\" or \"young plant\"."}}
