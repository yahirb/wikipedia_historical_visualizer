{"Newport_Beach": {"University Hills, Irvine": "University Hills is a housing development on the campus of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in southern Irvine, California, United States, consisting of 1066 for-sale homes and 360 rental units. University Hills was developed by the Irvine Campus Housing Authority, a not-for-profit corporation under the control of the university. UC Irvine developed the area as \" a way to compensate for high Orange County housing costs that can keep a recruit from accepting a job at the university.\" The land in University Hills is owned by the University of California and leased to homeowners; terms in the lease limit home ownership to university employees and restrict resale prices so that the homes remain affordable."}}
