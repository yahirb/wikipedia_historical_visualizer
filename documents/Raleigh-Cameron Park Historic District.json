{"Raleigh": {"Cameron Park Historic District": "Cameron Park is a historic neighborhood just west of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. It is one of three suburbs platted in the early 20th century. Development began along Hillsborough Street and moved north; a streetcar line along Hillsborough made the location especially appealing and convenient."}}
