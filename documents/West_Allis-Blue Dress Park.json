{"West_Allis": {"Blue Dress Park": "Blue Dress Park is the name given to a derelict piece of urban space in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by conceptual artist Paul Druecke in 2000. The site is located on the northwest edge of the Holton Street Bridge, where it connects the Milwaukee East Side neighborhoods of Brewer's Hill, Riverwest, and Brady Street, and is a large concrete expanse surrounded by a low iron fence. In the summer of 2000, Druecke staged a \"christening celebration\" with champagne and chamber music on the site, temporarily transforming it into a \"crowded meeting place\"."}}
