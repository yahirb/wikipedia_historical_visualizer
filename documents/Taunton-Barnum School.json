{"Taunton": {"Barnum School": "Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 \u2013 April 7, 1891) was an American showman, politician and businessman remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and for founding the Barnum & Bailey Circus (1871\u20132017). Although Barnum was also an author, publisher, philanthropist, and for some time a politician, he said of himself, \"I am a showman by profession...and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me,\" and his personal aim was \"to put money in his own coffers.\" Barnum is widely, but erroneously, credited with coining the phrase \"There's a sucker born every minute.\"\nBorn in Bethel, Connecticut, Barnum became a small-business owner in his early twenties and founded a weekly newspaper, before moving to New York City in 1834. He embarked on an entertainment career, first with a variety troupe called \"Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater\", and soon after by purchasing Scudder's American Museum, which he renamed after himself."}}
