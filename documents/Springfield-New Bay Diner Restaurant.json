{"Springfield": {"New Bay Diner Restaurant": "The New Bay Diner Restaurant is a historic diner at 950 Bay Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was manufactured by the Mountain View Diners Company in Signac, New Jersey (as #532) in 1957; it is believed to be the second-to-last diner the company built before it shut down later that year. The diner is attached to a concrete block structure which houses the kitchen and restrooms, and appears to also date to 1957."}}
