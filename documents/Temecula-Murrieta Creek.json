{"Temecula": {"Murrieta Creek": "Murrieta Creek, runs 13 miles (21 km) southeasterly through southwestern Riverside County, California, United States, through the communities of Wildomar, Murrieta, and Temecula, ending 0.5 miles (0.80 km) southeast of Temecula, where it has its confluence with Temecula Creek and forms the head of the Santa Margarita River.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe creek and town of Murrieta are not named for the bandit, Joaquin Murrieta, but for the pioneer sheep ranchers, Izaquel and Juan Murrietta, who purchased the Rancho Pauba and Rancho Temecula Mexican land grants. His brother returned to Spain, but Juan brought 100,000 sheep to the valley in 1873, using the meadows to feed his herd."}}
