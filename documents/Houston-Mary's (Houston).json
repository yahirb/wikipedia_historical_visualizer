{"Houston": {"Mary's (Houston)": "Mary's, originally called Mary's, Naturally and sometimes referred to as Mary's Lounge, was an iconic gay bar located in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, in the United States. The bar opened in 1968, and by the time of its permanent closing in November 2009, it was the oldest gay bar in Houston and one of the oldest in Texas. In 2011, OutSmart said that the bar \"anchored\" Houston's gay community in Montrose during its nearly forty-year history."}}
