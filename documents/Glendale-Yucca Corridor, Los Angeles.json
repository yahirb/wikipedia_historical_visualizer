{"Glendale": {"Yucca Corridor, Los Angeles": "The Yucca Corridor is a '\"formerly notorious\" and \"once crime-ridden\" stretch of Yucca Avenue in Hollywood, California, north of Hollywood Boulevard and Mann's Chinese Theater. Today it is said to be \"a hub for young professionals, artists, musicians and actors.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Yucca Corridor Coalition of Property Owners and Managers delineates Yucca Corridor as bounded on the west by North Highland Avenue, on the north by Franklin Avenue, on the east by Vine Street and on the south by a line \"just north of Hollywood Boulevard.\" In 2007 apartment condominiums were under development, but dwellers in the Corridor were mostly renters, and \"mostly singles just starting their careers.\" In that year boutiques lined Yucca Street, which was described as \"a trendy shopping spot hoping to rival Melrose Avenue\" as a commercial center. Area nightclubs were said to \"bolster the Yucca Corridor's thriving night life.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nBy 1993 the Corridor had been dominated for several years by the 18th Street Gang, according to Sharon Romero, leader of the Hollywood Beautification Team, which was formed to paint over graffiti, among other projects."}}
