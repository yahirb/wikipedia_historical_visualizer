{"Bayonne": {"Red Hook graving dock": "The Red Hook graving dock, initially known as \"Graving Dock One\", was a 730-foot-long (220 m) graving dock located at the Vigor Shipyards in Red Hook, Brooklyn in New York City. In its time, the dock was considered to have contributed to making Red Hook the \"center of the shipping industry in New York\" and was part of the city's largest dry dock and shipping dock.\nConstruction on the dock was completed in 1866 and the unit was utilized as a repair dock for large vessels until its closure in 2005, when the lease held by Stevens Technical Services expired."}}
