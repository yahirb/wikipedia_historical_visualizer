{"Lincoln": {"Abraham Lincoln (1912 statue)": "Abraham Lincoln \u2013 also known as The Gettysburg Lincoln \u2013 is a bronze statue of President Abraham Lincoln by Daniel Chester French, located on the grounds of the Nebraska State Capitol. The monument was commissioned by the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Association of Lincoln, Nebraska, and produced between 1909 and its unveiling in 1912.\nThe statue was cast in bronze by Jno. Williams, Inc. of New York. Its architectural setting was created by French's longtime collaborator Henry Bacon. The 8.67 ft (2.64 m) statue stands upon a 6 ft (1.83 m) granite base and before a 20 ft (6.1 m) granite stele, on which is inscribed the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\nFrench later used much of his research for this statue \u2013 consisting largely of studying Mathew Brady's photographs of Lincoln and obtaining a copy of Leonard Volk's plaster life cast of the president \u2013 in the creation of his most famous work: the Seated Lincoln statue (1920) at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C."}}
