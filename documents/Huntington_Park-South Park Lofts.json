{"Huntington_Park": {"South Park Lofts": "South Park Lofts, located in downtown Los Angeles, was built in 1924 as an eight-story parking garage. It was one of America's first parking structures, and is one of the few parking garages listed in the National Register of Historic Places, having received the distinction in 2004. The building has been converted to lofts and is now known as \"South Park Lofts.\" As \"Building at 816 Grand Avenue\", it is one of more than ten buildings designed by Claud Beelman listed on the National Register."}}
