{"White_Plains": {"Jacob Purdy House": "The Jacob Purdy House was used as General George Washington's headquarters in 1778 and possibly in 1776 during the Battle of White Plains in the American Revolutionary War. Originally constructed by Samuel Horton, it was purchased by Jacob Purdy's father, Samuel Purdy in 1730. It came into the possession of Jacob Purdy about 1785, in the aftermath of the war when some of the family had fled as United Empire Loyalists."}}
