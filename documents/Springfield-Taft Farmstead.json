{"Springfield": {"Taft Farmstead": "The Taft Farmstead is a historic farm located west of Rochester, Sangamon County, Illinois. Established in the early 20th century, the farm is one of the few intact farmsteads from the period which was not a renovation of an earlier farm. The farm's Classical Revival farmhouse, which dates from 1912, is representative of the spread of individualized architecture to farms; its design includes two-story Doric columns along the front porch and a pyramidal roof with a pediment-like dormer in front."}}
