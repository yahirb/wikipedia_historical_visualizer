{"Warwick": {"Cowesett Pound": "The Cowesett Pound is an historic animal pound on Cowesett Road in Warwick, Rhode Island. The pound, a roughly square structure built of unmortarted fieldstone four to five feet in height, is estimated to have been built in 1742 by David Greene, although there was an older (probably wooden) pound already at the site. Its walls were probably once topped by capstones, but only one of these survives."}}
