{"Yonkers": {"Our Lady of Victory Church (Bronx, New York)": "The Church of Our Lady of Victory, also known as the War Memorial Church, is a Roman Catholic parish church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 60 William Street on the northeast corner of William Street and Pine Street in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It was established in 1944, during World War II, by Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York and Apostolic Vicar for the U.S. Armed Forces from December 11, 1939 to December 2, 1967, at a time when \"victory in the war was in sight but not yet assured.\" A quote from Cardinal Spellman greets worshipers at the front door: \"This Holy Shrine is dedicated to Our Lady of Victory in Thanksgiving for Victory won by our valiant dead, our soldier\u2019s blood, our country\u2019s tears, shed to defend men\u2019s rights and win back men\u2019s hearts to God.\"\nA Soldier's Shrine is in the lower chapel, and the Teresa Benedicta Auschwitz Memorial in the lobby commemorates a victim of the Holocaust. A 9-11 Remembrance Book is displayed."}}
