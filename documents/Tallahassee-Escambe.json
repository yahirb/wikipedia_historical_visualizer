{"Tallahassee": {"Escambe": "Escambe (also known as San Cosme y San Dami\u00e1n de Cupaica, San Dami\u00e1n de Cupaica, San Cosmo Y San Damias De Escambe, or San Damian de Cupahica) was a Spanish Franciscan mission built in the 17th century in the Florida Panhandle, three miles northwest of the present-day town of Tallahassee, Florida. It was part of Spain's effort to colonize the region, and convert the Timucuan and Apalachee Indians to Christianity. The mission lasted until 1704, when it was destroyed by a group of Creek Indians and South Carolinians."}}
