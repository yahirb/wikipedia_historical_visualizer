{"Alexandria": {"Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop": "The Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop/Museum is a historic apothecary's shop in Alexandria, Virginia, USA, that has been preserved as a museum. During its working life, the drug company was owned by generations of a Quaker family. Eventually, a dramatic decline in sales during the Great Depression forced the shop to close its doors."}}
