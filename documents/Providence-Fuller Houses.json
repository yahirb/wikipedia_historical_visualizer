{"Providence": {"Fuller Houses": "The Fuller Houses are two historic homes at 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and are believed to have originally been identical in construction. The \u200b2 1\u20442-story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself."}}
