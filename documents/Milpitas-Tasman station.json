Tasman is served by both the Mountain View\u2013Winchester and Alum Rock\u2013Santa Teresa lines, and has served as the northern primary transfer point between the two lines since August 2005, when the line from Mountain View was reconfigured to serve downtown San Jose and no longer serve Baypointe station in preparation for the opening of the Vasona light rail extension project."}}
