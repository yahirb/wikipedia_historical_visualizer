{"Cincinnati": {"Textile Building (Cincinnati, OH)": "The Textile Building is a historic industrial building in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. The building was constructed in 1906 in a progressive attempt by the city to centralize its scattered garment and textile industries into singular buildings. Designed in the Commercial and Renaissance Revival styles by Cincinnati native and M.I.T. School of Architecture graduate Gustav W. Drach, the 12-story building is currently used for offices and storage."}}
