{"Mount_Vernon": {"Crestwood (Metro-North station)": "Crestwood (originally Yonkers Park) is a Metro-North Railroad station serving the residents of Crestwood and Tuckahoe, New York on the Harlem Line. It is 16.7 miles (26.9 km) from Grand Central Terminal. Because of its location at the northern end of the triple-track segment of the Harlem Line, Crestwood is often the first/last stop outside New York City on Harlem Line express trains, and its center island platform is frequently used to short turn local trains during rush hour."}}
