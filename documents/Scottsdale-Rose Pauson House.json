{"Scottsdale": {"Rose Pauson House": "The Rose Pauson House in Phoenix, Arizona, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1939 and built 1940\u20131942.\nIn 1943 the house burned down when a fallen ember from the fireplace ignited a hand-woven curtain on a nearby window. All that remained were the ruins of the foundation and walls."}}
