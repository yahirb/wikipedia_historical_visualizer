{"Springfield": {"Big \"O\"": "Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann\u2013Landau notation or asymptotic notation.\nIn computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows."}}
