{"Boston": {"Boston Transit Commission Building": "The Boston Transit Commission Building is an historic office building at 15 Beacon Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It served as the headquarters of the Boston Transit Commission, the nation's first public transportation agency, which was responsible for the initial creation of Boston's subway system (now operated by the commission's successor, the MBTA). The ten-story Classical Revival building was designed by William Gibbons Preston and built in 1903\u201304. The commission occupied the building until it went out of existence in 1916. The city took the property in 1920 by eminent domain, and used it to house the Boston School Committee. The city sold the building in 1998, and it is now home to XV Beacon, a luxury hotel.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007."}}
