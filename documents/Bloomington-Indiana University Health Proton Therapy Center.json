{"Bloomington": {"Indiana University Health Proton Therapy Center": "The Indiana University Health Proton Therapy Center, formerly known as the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute (MPRI), was the first proton facility in the Midwest. The center was located on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. The IU Health Proton Therapy Center was the only proton therapy center in the U.S. to use a uniform-scanning beam for dose delivery, which decreases undesirable neutron dose to patients."}}
