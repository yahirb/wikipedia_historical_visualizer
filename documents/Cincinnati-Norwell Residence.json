{"Cincinnati": {"Norwell Residence": "The Norwell Residence is a historic house in the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. A Victorian building constructed in 1890, it is a weatherboarded structure with a stone foundation and a shingled roof. The overall floor plan of the house is irregular: two and half stories tall, the house is shaped like the letter \"L\" but appears to be a rectangle, due to the presence of two separate porches that fill in the remaining area."}}
