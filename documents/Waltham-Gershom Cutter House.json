{"Waltham": {"Gershom Cutter House": "The Gershom Cutter House is a historic house at 1146 Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington, Massachusetts. Although traditionally ascribed a construction date of 1802, it is more likely, based on stylistic evidence and other documentary evidence, that this two story wood frame house was built c. 1835 by the sixth Gershom Cutter."}}
