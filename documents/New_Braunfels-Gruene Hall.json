{"New_Braunfels": {"Gruene Hall": "Gruene Hall, was built in 1878 by Henry (Heinrich) D. Gruene and is located in the historical town of Gruene, Texas (now a part of New Braunfels), and bills itself as \"the oldest continually run dance hall in Texas.\" By design, not much has physically changed since the Hall was first built. The 6,000 square foot dance hall with a high pitched tin roof still has the original layout with side flaps for open air dancing, a bar in the front, a small lighted stage in the back and a huge outdoor garden. Advertisement signs from the 1930s and 1940s still hang in the old hall and around the stage."}}
