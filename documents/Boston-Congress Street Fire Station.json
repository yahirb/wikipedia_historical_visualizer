{"Boston": {"Congress Street Fire Station": "The Congress Street Fire Station, now known as the Boston Fire Museum, is an historic fire station at 344 Congress Street in Boston, Massachusetts.\nThe Romanesque style station was designed by Harrison H. Atwood, then the city architect, and constructed in 1891. It is distinctive for its early use, within this style, of light-colored brick, and features a rusticated ground level and progressively more refined detailing as it rises."}}
