{"Hawthorne": {"Crenshaw station": "Crenshaw station is a Los Angeles County Metro Rail freeway median station on the Metro Green Line. It is located at Crenshaw Boulevard in the median of the Century Freeway in Hawthorne, California. It is not necessarily named for the Crenshaw district (to the north) as Metro Rail usually names most of their stations after the nearest major cross streets; in this case, it is named for Crenshaw Boulevard which indeed travels up to the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles."}}
