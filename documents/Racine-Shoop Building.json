{"Racine": {"Shoop Building": "The Shoop Building is a historic office building in downtown Racine, Wisconsin. Located next to the Root River at 215 State Street and 222 Main Street, its six-story height and contrast of Cream City brick and red sandstone make it a distinctive part of Racine's skyline. Constructed in stages between 1893 and 1902, the main part of the building was designed by local architect James Gilbert Chandler."}}
