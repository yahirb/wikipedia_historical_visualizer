{"Haverhill": {"Timothy Morse House": "The Timothy Morse House is a historic First Period house at 628 Main Street in West Newbury, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in stages beginning in 1730. Even though Georgian styling and construction techniques were already taking hold at that time, this house was built in a typical First Period style."}}
