{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Franklin Road Academy": "Franklin Road Academy (FRA) is a private, college preparatory, co-educational, Christian school for students in grades Pre-K3-12 located in Nashville, Tennessee. FRA was founded in 1971 after a court ordered Nashville public schools to expanded desegregation busing and, like other schools established in that period, has been described as segregation academy. The school was originally affiliated with the First Christian Church, but became a separate organization in 1982."}}
