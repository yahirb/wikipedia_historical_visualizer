{"Minneapolis": {"Soo Line Building": "The Soo Line Building is a 19-story residential highrise in Minneapolis, Minnesota which was the tallest commercial building in the city from the time it was completed in 1915 until the Foshay Tower was built in 1929. It was built for the First National Bank of Minneapolis, a predecessor of today's U.S. Bancorp (U.S. Bank). It later served for many years as headquarters of the Soo Line Railroad, which added an iconic clock to the corner of the building's street level."}}
