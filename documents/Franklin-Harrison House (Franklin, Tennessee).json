{"Franklin": {"Harrison House (Franklin, Tennessee)": "The Harrison House is historic slave plantation home property in Franklin, Tennessee that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1975. It was built perhaps in 1810 and was extended and remodelled in 1848 by William Harrison. The remodelling added a \"two-story entrance portico and second-story gallery porch typical of many antebellum homes.\"\nIt was the site of the last staff meeting of Confederate General John Bell Hood with his staff before the 1864 Battle of Franklin, on battlefield 3 miles (4.8 km) north."}}
