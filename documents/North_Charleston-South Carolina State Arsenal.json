{"North_Charleston": {"South Carolina State Arsenal": "The South Carolina State Arsenal (also locally familiar as \"The Old Citadel\") in Charleston, South Carolina was built in 1829 after the 1822 slave revolt led by Denmark Vesey. In 1842 the South Carolina Military Academy, a liberal arts military college, was established by the state legislature, and the school took over the arsenal the following year. The school became known as The Citadel because of the appearance of its building."}}
