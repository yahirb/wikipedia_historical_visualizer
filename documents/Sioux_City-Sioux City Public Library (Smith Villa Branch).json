{"Sioux_City": {"Sioux City Public Library (Smith Villa Branch)": "The Sioux City Public Library (Smith Villa Branch) is a historic building located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States. Local architect William L. Steele designed the Prairie School-style building, which was completed in 1927. This was long after the style was no longer fashionable in its native Chicago, but it shows its staying power in other areas of the Midwest."}}
