{"Tampa": {"The Refinery": "A refinery is a production facility composed of a group of chemical engineering unit processes and unit operations refining certain materials or converting raw material into products of value.\n\n\n== Types of refineries ==\nDifferent types of refineries are as follows:\npetroleum oil refinery, which converts crude oil into high-octane motor spirit (gasoline/petrol), diesel oil, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), kerosene, heating fuel oils, hexane, lubricating oils, bitumen and petroleum coke;\nfood oil refinery which converts cooking oil into a product that is uniform in taste, smell and appearance, and stability;\nsugar refinery, which converts sugar cane and sugar beets into crystallized sugar and sugar syrups;\nnatural gas processing plant, which purifies and converts raw natural gas into residential, commercial and industrial fuel gas, and also recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) such as ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes;\nsalt refinery, which cleans common salt (NaCl), produced by the solar evaporation of sea water, followed by washing and re-crystallization;\nmetal refineries refining metals such as alumina, copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, uranium, zinc, magnesium and cobalt;\n\n\n=== A typical oil refinery ===\n\nThe image below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical oil refinery depicting various unit processes and the flow of intermediate products between the inlet crude oil feedstock and the final products. The diagram depicts only one of the hundreds of different configurations."}}
