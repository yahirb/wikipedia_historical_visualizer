{"Encinitas": {"Solana Beach station": "Solana Beach, also known as the Solana Beach Transit Center, is a train station on Amtrak California's Pacific Surfliner passenger train and on North County Transit District's COASTER commuter rail route located in Solana Beach, California. The tracks were lowered to their current position in the late 90s, to alleviate congestion on Lomas Santa Fe Road and Downtown Solana Beach. There is enough room between the two tracks to create a third track, which could be used as a bypass track."}}
