{"Akron": {"Rolling Acres Mall": "Rolling Acres Mall was a retail mall located in the Rolling Acres area of Akron, Ohio, United States. Built in 1975 and expanded several times in its history, it once comprised more than 140 stores, including five anchor stores, a movie theater and a food court. The mall closed on October 31, 2008, leaving only two of its anchor stores in operation, Sears and JCPenney. In January 2011, Sears announced their store would close: the Sears store closed in April 2011, while JCPenney converted remaining outlets to \"JC's 5 Star Outlet\" stores. In 2013, JCPenney announced that it would close all remaining \"JC's Five Star Outlet\" stores, including the store at Rolling Acres. The store shut its doors on December 31, 2013, leaving the mall vacant of retail stores. The mall currently houses Storage of America and Pinnacle Recycling. One of the mall's dilapidated entrances appears as the cover art to The Black Keys' single \"Gold on the Ceiling\". The mall was nicknamed \"Rotting Acres Mall\" during its years of abandonment, in reference to the immense amount of black mold that grew throughout the mall, and the deterioration of the mall since it closed down."}}
