{"Palo_Alto": {"Googleplex": "The Googleplex is the corporate headquarters complex of Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc., located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California, United States, near Silicon Valley's capital San Jose.\nThe original complex, with 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) of office space, is the company's second largest square footage assemblage of Google buildings. (The largest single Google building is the 2,900,000-square-foot (270,000 m2) 111 Eighth Avenue building in New York City, which Google bought in 2010.) Once the 1,100,000-square-foot (100,000 m2) Bay View addition went online in 2015, the Googleplex became the largest collection of Google buildings with 3,100,000 square feet (290,000 m2) of space."}}
