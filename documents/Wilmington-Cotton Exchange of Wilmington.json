{"Wilmington": {"Cotton Exchange of Wilmington": "The Cotton Exchange of Wilmington, North Carolina is a shopping complex consisting of over eight historical buildings dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is so named due to the inclusion of the Old James Sprunt Cotton Exchange building; a business that claimed to be the largest exporter of cotton on the east coast until its dissolution in 1950. The Cotton Exchange is located on what is now North Front Street in downtown Wilmington."}}
