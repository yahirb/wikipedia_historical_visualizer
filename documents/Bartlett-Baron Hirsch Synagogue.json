{"Bartlett": {"Baron Hirsch Synagogue": "The Baron Hirsch Synagogue (also Baron Hirsch Congregation), established in Memphis, Tennessee circa 1862\u20131864, is a flagship of American Orthodox Judaism. From modest beginnings, it underwent tremendous growth in the first half of the 20th century, emerging, in the 1950s, as the largest Orthodox congregation in North America, a position it still holds.\nIts former building, an impressive International Style structure built in the 1950s, is a U.S. Historic District Contributing Property and the centerpiece of the Vollintine Hills Historic District, a cohesive collection of 78 post-World War II Minimal Traditional and ranch-style houses built around the former synagogue by members of the congregation."}}
