{"Tampa": {"Marti-Colon Cemetery": "Marti-Colon Cemetery is a historic cemetery in West Tampa, maintained and partially owed by the City of Tampa. It currently lies south of Columbus Drive, though for the first sixty years of the cemetery\u2019s life, it extended north of Columbus. Marti-Colon has come into the news several times since its inception in the late 19th century, with reports of unscrupulous practices by owners and a lack of oversight by the government officials."}}
