{"Kirkland": {"Peace Park (Seattle)": "Peace Park is a park located in the University District of Seattle, Washington, at the corner of N.E. 40th Street and 9th Avenue N.E., at the northern end of the University Bridge. Built by Floyd Schmoe, winner of the 1988 Hiroshima Peace Prize, and dedicated on August 6, 1990, 45 years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, it is home to a full-size bronze statue of Sadako Sasaki sculpted by Daryl Smith. After the statue was vandalized in December 2003, a number of people, including Sadako's family, requested the statue be relocated to the more heavily trafficked Green Lake Park."}}
