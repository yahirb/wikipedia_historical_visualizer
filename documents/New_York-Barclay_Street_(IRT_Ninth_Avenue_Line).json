{"New_York": {"Barclay Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line)": "The IRT Ninth Avenue Line, often called the Ninth Avenue El, was the first elevated railway in New York City. It opened on July 3, 1868 as the West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, as an experimental single-track cable-powered elevated railway from Battery Place, at the south end of Manhattan Island, northward up Greenwich Street to Cortlandt Street. It ceased operation on June 11, 1940, after it was replaced by the IND Eighth Avenue Line which had opened in 1932.\nThe last section in use, over the Harlem River, was known as the Polo Grounds Shuttle, and closed on August 31, 1958. This portion used the now-removed Putnam Bridge swing bridge and went through a tunnel, complete with partially underground stations."}}
