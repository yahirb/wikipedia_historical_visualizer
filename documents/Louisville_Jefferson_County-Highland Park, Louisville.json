{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"Highland Park, Louisville": "Highland Park was a city near and eventually neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky that was razed as a part of the expansion of Louisville International Airport. Its boundaries were roughly the CSX railroad tracks to the west, and what would become the Kentucky State Fair & Exposition Center and the airport on all other sides (initially these were farm land).\nHighland Park was originally built largely for workers at the nearby Louisville & Nashville Railroad yard, with professor and businessman T. C. H. Vance laying out streets in the 1880s."}}
