{"Honolulu": {"Manoa": "M\u0101noa (, or informally ) is a valley and a residential neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi. The neighborhood is approximately three miles (5 km) east and inland from downtown Honolulu and less than a mile (1600 m) from Ala Moana and Waik\u012bk\u012b at 21\u00b018.87916\u2032N 157\u00b048.4846\u2032W.\nSimilar to many Honolulu neighborhoods, M\u0101noa consists of an entire valley, running from M\u0101noa Falls at the mauka (inland-most) end to King Street. The valley receives almost daily rain, even during the dry season, and is thus richly vegetated \u2013 though the valley walls are often dry."}}
