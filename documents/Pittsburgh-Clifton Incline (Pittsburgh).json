{"Pittsburgh": {"Clifton Incline (Pittsburgh)": "The Clifton Incline was a funicular that operated from 1889 to 1905 in what is now the Perry Hilltop neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It extended from its base at Sarah Street (now Strauss Street) at the intersection with Myrtle Street (now the closed Metcalf Street) to its top landing at Clifton Park near the end of Clifton Street (now Chautauqua Street).\nBusinessman William McCreery co-founded the incline to facilitate access to a residential neighborhood developed from his former estate."}}
