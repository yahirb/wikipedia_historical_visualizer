{"Medford": {"William Cook House (Cambridge, Massachusetts)": "The William Cook House is an historic house at 71 Appleton Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States of America. The 2.5 story brick house was built in 1877, and is distinctive as a transitional Stick style/Queen Anne building executed using a rare construction material (brick) for a residence in Cambridge. Queen Anne styling is evident in the varied massing and gables, and in the polychrome brick surface."}}
