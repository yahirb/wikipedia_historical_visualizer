{"Anchorage": {"Civil Works Residential Dwellings": "The Civil Works Residential Dwellings, also known as the Brown's Point Cottages and Corps of Engineers Houses, are a pair of historic houses at 786 and 800 Delaney Street in Anchorage, Alaska. The two houses, mirror images of one another, are single-story wood frame structures with wide clapboard siding, a metal gable roof, and an attached single-car garage. Built in 1941 to house officers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, they are among the least-altered of Anchorage's World War II-era military facilities."}}
