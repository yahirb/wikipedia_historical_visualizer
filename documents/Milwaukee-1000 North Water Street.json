{"Milwaukee": {"1000 North Water Street": "1000 North Water Street is a 16-story 296-foot-tall (90 m) post-modern high-rise office building in Milwaukee, in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is the twelfth-tallest building in Milwaukee, and was completed in 1991, right at the tail end of a construction boom in Milwaukee that started in the late 1980s, and included 100 East Wisconsin, Northwestern Mutual Tower, and the Milwaukee Center. The facade and windows are a light pink color, giving it a unique appearance among Milwaukee's skyline."}}
