{"Kansas_City": {"Shawnee Methodist Mission": "Shawnee Methodist Mission was established by missionaries in 1830 in Turner, Kansas to minister to the Shawnee tribe of Native Americans who had been removed to Kansas. In 1839 the mission relocated to Fairway, where it built a brick building referred to by names varying from Shawnee Indian Methodist Manual Labor School. It was one of the first such missions established in the territory acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase."}}
