{"Pittsburgh": {"Three Sisters (Pittsburgh)": "The Three Sisters are three very similar self-anchored suspension bridges spanning the Allegheny River in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 6th, 7th, and 9th streets, generally running north/south. The bridges have been given formal names to honor important Pittsburgh residents:\nRoberto Clemente (Sixth Street Bridge)\nAndy Warhol (Seventh Street Bridge)\nRachel Carson (Ninth Street Bridge)\nDesigned by the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, they were all built in a four-year period, from 1924 to 1928, by the American Bridge Company, replacing earlier bridges of various designs at the same sites. Their construction was mandated by the War Department, citing navigable river clearance concerns."}}
