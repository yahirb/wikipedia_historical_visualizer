{"Cleveland": {"Rockefeller Building (Cleveland)": "The Rockefeller Building is a historic high-rise office building in downtown Cleveland, Ohio that was built in 1903-1905 and sits at the corner of West 6th and Superior Avenue across from the Tower City Center complex. The building stands at a height of 212 ft. (64.62 m), rising 17 stories above the street and is named after the Standard Oil of Ohio founder John D. Rockefeller. The massively wide building acts as an entry point into the very popular and populated Warehouse District, Cleveland. In 1973, the building was put on the list of National Register of Historic Places.\nThere can never be any question that Rockefeller was instrumental in helping build Cleveland into the industrial powerhouse it still is today. There are many things in the city named after him including Rockefeller Park, The Rockefeller City Greenhouse, and Rockefeller Avenue, however, his namesake building is the most lasting and most recognizable epitaph to the Cleveland billionaire. Rockefeller was known for his generosity towards his native city, his legacy of giving and spending money on Cleveland projects and parks is still widely felt today."}}
