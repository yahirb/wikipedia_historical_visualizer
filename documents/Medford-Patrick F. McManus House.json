{"Medford": {"Patrick F. McManus House": "The Patrick F. McManus House (also known as the Hiram Colver House) was built sometime between 1853 and 1855 by sutler and prospector Patrick F. McManus. McManus was one of the first of a group of white men in 1853 to reach what is now called Crater Lake as part of the Hillman group of prospectors. It sits on the Corner of 1st and Church Streets in Phoenix, Oregon and was built on the corner of one of the first donation land claims in the area belonging to Samuel Colver."}}
