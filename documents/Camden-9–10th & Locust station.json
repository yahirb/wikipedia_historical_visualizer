{"Camden": {"9\u201310th & Locust station": "9\u201310th & Locust is a PATCO Lindenwold Line subway station in Philadelphia. The station is located in the Washington Square West neighborhood of Center City, Philadelphia, near Wills Eye Hospital and Walnut Street Theatre.\nBecause there is no concourse connection with any other subway station, this station closes every night from 12:07 \u2013 5 AM due to crime concerns, thus making it the only station on the line that is not open 24 hours a day."}}
