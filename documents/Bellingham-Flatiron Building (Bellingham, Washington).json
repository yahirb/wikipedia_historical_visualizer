{"Bellingham": {"Flatiron Building (Bellingham, Washington)": "The Hamilton Building also known as The Flatiron Building of Bellingham was the first \"skyscraper\" in Bellingham. Built in 1908 for Talifero Simpson Hamilton's growing Bellingham Bay (B.B.) Furniture Company established in 1889, the building cost $100,000 and used thirty-five thousand barrels of cement along with 200,000 pounds of steel. Due to its triangular shape and resemblance to the Fuller Building in New York, the building instantly garnered the flatiron nickname."}}
