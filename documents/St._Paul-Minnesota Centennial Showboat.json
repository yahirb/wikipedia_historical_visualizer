{"St._Paul": {"Minnesota Centennial Showboat": "Minnesota Centennial Showboat was a traditional riverboat theatre docked at Harriet Island Regional Park on the banks of the Mississippi River in Downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. The showboat contained an intimate jewelbox theatre that seats 225. The interior is decorated to keep in time with the Victorian Era style that is expected of most showboats."}}
