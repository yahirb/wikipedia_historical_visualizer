The collision forced the first four cars of the rear train off the elevated tracks, killing 11 people and injuring over 180 as the cars fell onto the street below.\n\n\n== Infrastructure layout ==\n\"The Loop\" not only refers to Chicago's central business district, but also a rectangular pattern formed by the city's elevated trains."}}
