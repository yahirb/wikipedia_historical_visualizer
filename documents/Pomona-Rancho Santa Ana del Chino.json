{"Pomona": {"Rancho Santa Ana del Chino": "Rancho Santa Ana del Chino was a 22,193-acre (89.81 km2) Mexican land grant in the Chino Hills and southwestern Pomona Valley, in present-day San Bernardino County, California.\nIt was granted to Antonio Maria Lugo in 1841 by Mexican Alta California Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. The name literally means \"Santa Ana of the Fair Hair,\" though there have been statements that the ranch was named for a mission mayordomo, or foreman, who had curly hair, \"chino\" being also a Spanish word for \"curly\".\nThe rancho site included the present day cities of Chino, California and Chino Hills, California."}}
