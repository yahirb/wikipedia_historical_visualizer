{"New_Haven": {"Yale Bowl": "The Yale Bowl is a college football stadium in the northeast United States, located in New Haven, Connecticut, on the border of West Haven, about 1\u00bd miles (2\u00bd km) west of the main campus of Yale University. The home of the Yale Bulldogs of the Ivy League, it opened 104 years ago in 1914 with 70,896 seats; renovations have reduced its current capacity to 61,446.\nThe Yale Bowl inspired the design and naming of the Rose Bowl, from which is derived the name of college football's post-season games (\"bowl games\") and the NFL's \"Super Bowl\"."}}
