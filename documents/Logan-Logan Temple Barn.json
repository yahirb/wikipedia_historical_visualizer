{"Logan": {"Logan Temple Barn": "The Logan Temple Barn was built in Logan, Utah in 1896-97 to house the animals belonging to Mormons working at or attending the nearby Logan Temple. It is unique as one of only two stone barns in the Cache Valley, where wood-frame barns prevailed. The temple barn fell into disuse after automobiles began to bring worshipers to the temple and was sold in 1919, becoming an automobile repair shop."}}
