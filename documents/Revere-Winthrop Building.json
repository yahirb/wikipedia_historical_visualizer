{"Revere": {"Winthrop Building": "The Winthrop Building is an historic skyscraper at 7 Water Street (intersection with Washington Street) in Boston, Massachusetts.\nThe nine story brick and terracotta building was designed by Clarence H. Blackall in the Renaissance Revival style, and has the distinction of being the first skyscraper in the city to have been constructed with a steel frame. Completed in 1894, it was originally known as the Carter Building, but was renamed the Winthrop Building in 1899 after the Puritan Governor John Winthrop, whose second house was located adjacent to the site."}}
