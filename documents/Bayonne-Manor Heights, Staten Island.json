{"Bayonne": {"Manor Heights, Staten Island": "Manor Heights is a neighborhood located in Staten Island, New York City. Manor comes from the fact that the neighborhood is adjacent to Manor Road, a major thoroughfare in the North Shore of Staten Island, and Heights due to the area's sudden elevation within its boundaries. The neighborhood's loose boundaries include the areas south of the Staten Island Expressway, north of Brielle Avenue, which is the location of Susan E. Wagner High School, to the west of Manor Road, and to the east of Bradley Avenue."}}
