{"Las_Vegas": {"El Cortez (Las Vegas)": "The El Cortez, a hotel and casino, is a relatively small downtown Las Vegas gaming venue a block from the Fremont Street Experience and Las Vegas Boulevard. The official marketing slogan has been \"Where locals come to play\" since the El Cortez has traditionally attracted Las Vegas residents weary of large casinos geared towards tourists. Slots, table games, and a race and sports book occupy one floor of the main pavilion."}}
