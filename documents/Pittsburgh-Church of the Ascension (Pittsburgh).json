{"Pittsburgh": {"Church of the Ascension (Pittsburgh)": "Church of the Ascension located at Ellsworth Avenue and Neville Street in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was built in 1898. The church was added to the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 1971.\nLike nearly all the Episcopal churches of the Pittsburgh area in the first half of the 20th Century, the church boasted a really fine professional choir of men and boys that dominated the Sunday services, performing the music-heavy ritual of Morning Prayer from the 1928 Book of Common Prayer three Sundays out of four, the fourth Sunday being devoted to the celebration of Holy Communion."}}
