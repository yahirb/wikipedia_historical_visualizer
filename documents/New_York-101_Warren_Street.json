The project features an \"Artrium\" on the fifth floor with a pine tree forest consisting of 101 trees.\nIt is across the street from the very popular P.S. 234, which is noted for the nautical design by Richard Dattner of its fence and the building also has a Whole Foods store and a Barnes & Noble store. Its double-height lobbies have murals by Roy Lichtenstein and the building was designed with a distinctive, elongated \"checkerboard\" fa\u00e7ade design.\nAn earlier building at 101 Warren Street, the Tarrant Building, was destroyed by an explosion and fire in October 1900.\nThe Mattlage Building, a 12-story office building, was later built at the site and numbered as 97\u2013101 Warren Street. In 1942, the building was sold by a person or company identified as \"Irving\". In 1951, plans were announced to sell the building by auction. In 1957, Office Structure bought the building."}}
