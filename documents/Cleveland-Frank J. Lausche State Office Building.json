{"Cleveland": {"Frank J. Lausche State Office Building": "The Frank J. Lausche State Office Building is a 1979-erected 204 foot 15 story high-rise in downtown Cleveland on the corner of West Superior and Prospect Avenue on the city's Tower City Center complex. It sits in front of the 2002-built Carl B. Stokes United States Courthouse. The buildings majority of tenants (over 1300) work for the State of Ohio. The structure cost the state $26 million to build in 1977-1979.  That would be about $83.5 million in today's inflation rate. In front of the building sits sculptor Tony Smith's Last which serves as a testament to both the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio's dedication to public art.\nThe uniquely shaped structure is actually seven-sided, which closely resembles the dimensions of the land it is built on as no more land was allotted to the project due to the fact that the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority owned the air rights. The building was erected by the firm of Robert P. Madison of Madison Madison International, a famous Cleveland architectural firm."}}
