{"Mount_Vernon": {"Happy Land fire": "The Happy Land fire was an act of arson that killed 87 people trapped in the unlicensed Happy Land social club at 1959 Southern Boulevard in the West Farms section of the Bronx in New York City on March 25, 1990. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Carnival, many of them part of the Garifuna American community. Unemployed Cuban refugee Julio Gonz\u00e1lez, whose former girlfriend was employed at the club, was arrested soon afterward and ultimately convicted of arson and murder."}}
