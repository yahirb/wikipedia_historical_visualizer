{"Cambridge": {"House at 6 Kent Court": "The House at 6 Kent Court is a historic colonial-era house in Somerville, Massachusetts. The Georgian style house was built in 1750, and is one of the oldest buildings in the city. It is known that there were a number of houses in this area, but it is likely that this house was moved, possible from Somerville Avenue, around the turn of the 20th century."}}
