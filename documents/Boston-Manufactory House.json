{"Boston": {"Manufactory House": "The Manufactory House in Boston, Massachusetts, was a linen manufactory built in 1753 to provide employment for local women and girls. The business failed, and the building was rented out to various tenants.\nIn 1768, it was the site of a standoff between townspeople and occupying British soldiers. Governor Francis Bernard had offered the use of the building to the 14th regiment, but the building's existing tenants refused to leave. The incident, although minor, was arguably the first violent confrontation between Americans and British soldiers."}}
