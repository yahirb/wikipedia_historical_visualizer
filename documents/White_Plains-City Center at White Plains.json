{"White_Plains": {"City Center at White Plains": "City Center at White Plains is a large mixed-use development shopping complex in downtown White Plains, New York. It features two 35-story apartment and condominium towers, 600,000-square-foot (60,000 m2) of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities. City Center's opening in 2003 marked the beginning of a new downtown development renaissance, and with the improving economy and healthy office leasing activity, White Plains entered the new millennium as the leading retail and office center in Westchester County."}}
