{"Salem": {"Lake Allison": "Lake Allison was a temporary lake in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, formed periodically by the Missoula Floods from 15,000 to 13,000 BC. The lake is the main cause for the rich and fertile soil that Willamette Valley is now recognized for.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWillamette Valley fertility, like the Palouse silt is in large part due to the largest freshwater flood scientifically documented in history. The ice floods started in Lake Missoula in Montana 12,000 to 15,000 years ago during the Pleistocene and flowed down through eastern Washington State, bringing fertile soil to the valley as it flowed out Columbia River Gorge."}}
