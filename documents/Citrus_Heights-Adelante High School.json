{"Citrus_Heights": {"Adelante High School": "Adelante High School is one of seven high schools in the Roseville Joint Union High School District in Roseville, Placer County, California. Established in 1965, Adelante High School had only eight students and one instructor and occupied a single room of the Roseville City District's Atlantic Street School. The following year, Adelante moved to the Placer County Fairgrounds where the program grew steadily as the demand for alternative education grew."}}
