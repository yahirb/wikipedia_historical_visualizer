The complex consisted of two all-residential towers, Lighthouse Landing I and Lighthouse Landing II, and would have been built on a parking lot in the Flats of Downtown Cleveland. The two proposed structures would have contained 22 and 18 floors, respectively, and would have been among the tallest all-residential buildings in Cleveland."}}
