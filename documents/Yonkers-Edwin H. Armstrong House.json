{"Yonkers": {"Edwin H. Armstrong House": "The Edwin H. Armstrong House, in Yonkers in Westchester County, New York, is unusual for having achieved listing on the National Register of Historic Places and even designation as a National Historic Landmark, only to be demolished. Its subsequent removal from National Historic Landmark status is the only such occurrence for a New York State site.\nIt was the home of Edwin H. Armstrong, inventor of two circuits that are the basis of modern telecommunication systems, and also inventor of wide-band frequency modulation (FM) radio."}}
