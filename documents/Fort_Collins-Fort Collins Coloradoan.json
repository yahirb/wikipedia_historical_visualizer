{"Fort_Collins": {"Fort Collins Coloradoan": "The Coloradoan is a daily newspaper in Fort Collins, Colorado. The Coloradoan's website is updated throughout the day with breaking news and video coverage of community news. It serves as a news bureau for KUSA-TV in Denver (officially known as the station's 'Northern Newsroom'), with a portion of the newsroom set up as a small television studio (KUSA-TV was formerly under fellow Gannett ownership until the 2015 spin-off of its broadcast assets as TEGNA Media, though the news-sharing relationship remains)."}}
