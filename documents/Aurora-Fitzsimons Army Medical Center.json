{"Aurora": {"Fitzsimons Army Medical Center": "Fitzsimons Army Hospital \u2014 known as Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC) from 1974 \u2014 was a U.S. Army facility located on 577 acres (234 ha) in Aurora, Colorado, USA. The facility opened in 1918 and closed in 1999; the grounds are currently being redeveloped for civilian use as the Anschutz Medical Campus and the Fitzsimons Life Science District.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe facility was founded by the United States Army during World War I arising from the need to treat the large number of casualties from chemical weapons in Europe. Denver's reputation as a prime location for the treatment of tuberculosis led local citizens to lobby the Army on behalf of Denver as the site for the new hospital."}}
