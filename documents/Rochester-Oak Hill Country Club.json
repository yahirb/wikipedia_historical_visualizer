{"Rochester": {"Oak Hill Country Club": "Oak Hill Country Club, located in Pittsford, New York, a suburb southeast of Rochester, has a rich history of golf. It started out in 1901 as only 9 holes on 85 acres (0.34 km2) on the banks of the Genesee River in Rochester. The clubhouse was no more than a converted farm house."}}
