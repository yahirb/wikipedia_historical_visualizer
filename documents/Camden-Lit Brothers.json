{"Camden": {"Lit Brothers": "Lit Brothers was a moderately-priced department store based in Philadelphia. Samuel and Jacob Lit opened the first store at North 8th and Market Streets in 1891. Lits positioned itself well as a more affordable alternate to competitors Strawbridge and Clothier, John Wanamaker, and Gimbels."}}
