{"Honolulu": {"Kamehameha V Post Office": "Kamehameha V Post Office at the corner of Merchant and Bethel Streets in Honolulu, Hawaii was the first building in the Hawaiian Islands to be constructed entirely of precast concrete blocks reinforced with iron bars. It was built by J.G. Osborne in 1871 and the success of this new method was replicated on a much grander scale the next year in the royal palace, Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 5 May 1972."}}
