{"Lafayette": {"Borden's Ice Cream": "Borden's Ice Cream is a historic ice cream parlor on Johnston Street in Lafayette, Louisiana, which was built in 1940. In 1981, the then owner, lifelong Lafayette resident Flora Levy, died. Her will stipulated a large bequest to the University of Louisiana Lafayette's Foundation; the ice cream parlor was part of that bequest."}}
