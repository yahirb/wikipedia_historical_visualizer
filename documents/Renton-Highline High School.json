{"Renton": {"Highline High School": "Highline High School is a high school in Burien, Washington, United States, located about 3.5 highway miles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Highline High School, the flagship high school of the Highline School District, opened its doors in 1924 and served the cities of Burien, Des Moines, and an area south of Seattle now known as White Center. Today those cities all have their own area high schools, but at the time Highline was the only high school in the area."}}
