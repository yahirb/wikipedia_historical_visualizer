{"Providence": {"Pekin Street Historic District": "The Pekin Street Historic District is a residential historic district bounded by Pekin and Candace Streets, Douglas and Chalkstone Avenues in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a well-preserved densely built neighborhood of working class housing, built almost entirely between 1870 and 1910. Most of the structures are either two or three-family units, with two-families predominating among the older buildings and triple-deckers among the later ones."}}
