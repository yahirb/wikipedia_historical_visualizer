{"Redmond": {"United States lightship Swiftsure (LV-83)": "Swiftsure (LV-83), is a lightship and museum ship moored at the Northwest Seaport in Seattle, Washington. Launched in 1904 at Camden, New Jersey and in active service until 1960 after serving on all five of the American west coast's lightship stations, she is one of the oldest surviving lightships in the United States, and the only one still fitted with its original steam engine. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989, and has been undergoing major restoration since 2011."}}
