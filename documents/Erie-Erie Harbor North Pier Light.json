{"Erie": {"Erie Harbor North Pier Light": "The Erie Harbor North Pier Light, also known as the Presque Isle North Pier Light, is one of the three lighthouses near Erie, Pennsylvania in the United States. The light, situated at the far eastern end of Presque Isle State Park, helps mariners as they traverse the narrow inlet between Lake Erie and Presque Isle Bay.\nOriginally constructed as a wooden tower in 1830, that light was swept away by a schooner in 1857."}}
