{"Iowa_City": {"Letovsky-Rohret House": "The Letovsky-Rohret House is a historic building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. This simple two-story wood frame structure largely embodies the Greek Revival style with its side gable roof, entablature window and door heads, boxed cornice and plain frieze, and its pedimented attic vents. The tall windows on the first floor and arched windows on the main door reflect elements of the Italianate style."}}
