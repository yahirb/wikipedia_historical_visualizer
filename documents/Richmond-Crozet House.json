{"Richmond": {"Crozet House": "Crozet House, also known as the Curtis Carter House, is a historic home located in Richmond, Virginia. It was built in 1814, and was originally built as a two-story, five bay, \"L\"-shaped brick house over a raised basement in the late-Federal style. It obtained its present \"U\"-shape after the addition of an east wing to the rear of the house."}}
