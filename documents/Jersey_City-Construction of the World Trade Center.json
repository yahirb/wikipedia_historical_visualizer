{"Jersey_City": {"Construction of the World Trade Center": "The construction of the first World Trade Center complex in New York City was conceived as an urban renewal project, spearheaded by David Rockefeller, to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki who came up with the specific idea for twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York state governments, which oversee the Port Authority, agreed to support the World Trade Center project, which was built at the site of Radio Row in the Lower West Side of Manhattan, New York City."}}
