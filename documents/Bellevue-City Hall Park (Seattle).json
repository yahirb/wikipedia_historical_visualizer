{"Bellevue": {"City Hall Park (Seattle)": "City Hall Park is a 1.3 ac (5.3 ha) park located in the Pioneer Square neighborhood of Seattle, Washington on a block bounded by 3rd Avenue on the southwest, Dilling Way on the southeast, 4th Avenue on the northeast, and the King County Courthouse on the northwest. It is so named because when it was laid out in 1916, the King County Courthouse was the County-City Building, housing both Seattle and King County government. City offices moved out in 1962."}}
