{"St._Paul": {"Riverside Hangar": "The Riverside Hangars are semi-cylindrical-shaped hangars for aircraft installed at Saint Paul Downtown Airport in 1942, immediately adjacent to the Mississippi River. Their important design features are their low-cost and that they were erectable quickly by unskilled workers. Due to frequent flooding, proposals have been introduced to build a flood wall on the riverbank, but opposition and cost have thus far squelched the plans."}}
