{"Worcester": {"James O'Connor Three-Decker": "The James O'Connor Three-Decker is a historic triple-decker at 23 Endicott Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. At time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was recognized as a well-preserved example of a wood-frame Queen Anne building, featuring a three-story porch with decorative turned wood balusters and porch supports, and wood siding with decorative bands of cut shingles. It was built about 1906, in what was then an ethnically mixed neighborhood; its early occupants were Irish and Swedish, with Poles and Lithuanians arriving later."}}
