{"Cranston": {"Apponaug, Rhode Island": "Apponaug is a neighborhood in central Warwick, Rhode Island, situated on Apponaug Cove, a tributary to Greenwich Bay and nearby Narragansett Bay. The name Apponaug is a derivation of the Narragansett Indian word for \"place of oysters\". Indeed, Apponaug Cove holds one of the richest shellfish beds in the United States and was densely populated by the Narragansetts for many centuries prior to the arrival of European settlers."}}
