{"Meriden": {"Cathole Mountain": "Cathole Mountain, 515 feet (157 m), is the lowest peak in the trap rock Hanging Hills of Meriden, Connecticut. The rugged southern ledges of the mountain rise steeply 150 feet (46 m) above the city of Meriden. The mountain is separated from South Mountain by the narrow, rocky Cathole Pass through which Connecticut Route 71 ascends."}}
