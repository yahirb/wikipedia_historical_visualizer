{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"Patriots Peace Memorial": "Patriots Peace Memorial is a monument in eastern Louisville, Kentucky near the banks of the Ohio River. In 2000, County Judge-Executive Rebecca Jackson appointed a committee of local retired and former military personnel, as well as family members of local United States military personnel, to visualize, conceive, fund and erect a suitable memorial honoring fallen patriots from all the military services. With the generous financial support of David and Betty Jones, as well as numerous local foundations, corporations, veterans' organizations, families, friends and patriotic citizens, the dream became a reality on Veterans Day, November 11, 2002."}}
