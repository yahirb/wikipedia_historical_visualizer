{"Racine": {"Thomas P. Hardy House": "The Thomas P. Hardy House is a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Prairie school home in Racine, Wisconsin, USA, that was built in 1905. The street-facing side of the house is mostly stucco, giving the residents privacy from the nearby sidewalk and street, but the expansive windows on the other side open up to Lake Michigan.\nPerched on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, the house is built vertically up and down the hillside, and has a partial basement."}}
