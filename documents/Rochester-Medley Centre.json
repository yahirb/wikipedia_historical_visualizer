{"Rochester": {"Medley Centre": "Medley Centre is a defunct shopping mall in Irondequoit, New York, a suburb of Rochester. The mall opened in 1990 as Irondequoit Mall, but early success gave way to dwindling patronage. At its peak, it featured four anchor stores: J. C. Penney (later Steve & Barry's), Sears, Sibley's (later Kaufmann's and Macy's), and McCurdy's (later The Bon-Ton)."}}
