{"Huntington_Park": {"Original Pantry Cafe": "The Original Pantry Cafe is a coffee shop and restaurant in Los Angeles, California. Located at the corner of 9th and Figueroa in Downtown L.A.'s South Park district, The Pantry (as it is known by locals) claims to never have closed or been without a customer since it opened including when it changed locations in 1950 to make room for a freeway off-ramp; it served lunch in the original location and served dinner at the new location the same day. It was, however, closed briefly at the order of health inspectors on November 26, 1997, and reopened the next day."}}
