{"Union_City": {"Centerville Pioneer Cemetery": "The Centerville Pioneer Cemetery, also known as the Centerville Presbyterian Cemetery, is located at the corner of Post Street and Bonde Way in Fremont, Alameda County, California, and was officially designated a state cemetery in 1858 or 1859 depending upon the source. At the time it was established the cemetery was in Washington Township, which was made up of the villages of Mission San Jose, Irvington, Warm Springs, Centerville, Niles, Newark, Alvarado and Decoto. All of the villages eventually became towns of the same names and the church and cemetery were renamed to reflect their location in Centerville."}}
