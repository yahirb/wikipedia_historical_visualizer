Originally designed as an office tower, it was converted into apartments in 1997, following a conversion trend that had been gradually picking up speed and gaining popularity in the 1980s and 90s, and was renamed 'Le Rivage Apartments'. In 2016 this 33-story tower was re-branded again, this time simply as '21 West Street'."}}
