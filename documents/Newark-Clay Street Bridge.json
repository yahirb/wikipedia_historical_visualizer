{"Newark": {"Clay Street Bridge": "The Clay Street Bridge is a bridge on the Passaic River between Newark and East Newark, New Jersey. The swing bridge is the 13th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is 6.1 miles (9.8 km) upstream from it. Opened in 1903, the Warren through truss rim-bearing bridge was substantially rehabilitated in 1975-1976, its original working parts now part of the collection of the Newark Museum."}}
