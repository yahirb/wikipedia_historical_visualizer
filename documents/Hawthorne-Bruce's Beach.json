{"Hawthorne": {"Bruce's Beach": "Bruce's Beach was a small beach resort in the city of Manhattan Beach, California, that was owned by and operated for African Americans. It provided the African American community with opportunities unavailable at other beach areas because of segregation.\nAs a result of racial friction from disgruntled white neighbors, the property was seized using eminent domain proceedings in the 1920s and closed down."}}
