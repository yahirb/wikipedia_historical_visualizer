{"North_Little_Rock": {"Fort Logan H. Roots": "Fort Logan H. Roots (usually referred to simply as Fort Roots) was a military base located in North Little Rock, Arkansas, set on a high promontory overlooking the Arkansas River. The land was traded to the Federal Government in 1892 in exchange for the property now known as MacArthur Park, in Little Rock, which had been a military arsenal since the 1830s when Arkansas was a territory. The base was named for Congressman Logan H. Roots in recognition for his work in the negotiations."}}
