{"Waltham": {"Kendal Green Historic District": "The Kendal Green Historic District is a rural residential district running along North Avenue (Massachusetts Route 117) in Weston, Massachusetts. It extends for about three-quarters of a mile, and includes elements representative of the development of Weston from a rural agricultural community to a residential suburb of Boston. In addition to a variety of predominantly residential and agricultural properties, it includes two formerly industrial sites important in Weston's history: the site of the Hobbs Tannery, and that of the Hook and Hastings Organ Factory."}}
