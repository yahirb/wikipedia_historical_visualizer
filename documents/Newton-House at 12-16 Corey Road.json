{"Newton": {"House at 12-16 Corey Road": "The House at 12\u201316 Corey Road in Brookline, Massachusetts is a distinctive local example of townhouses in an English Revival style with Shingle elements. The townhouses were designed by Arthur H. Bowdith, a prominent local architect, and built in 1896 for Alan Arthur and Gardiner Shaw, two real estate agents. The townhouses have steeply-pitched shingled gables, projecting diamond-pane windows, and bracketed bargeboard trim."}}
