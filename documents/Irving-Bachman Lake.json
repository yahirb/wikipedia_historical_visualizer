{"Irving": {"Bachman Lake": "Bachman Lake is a small freshwater lake located in the Love Field neighborhood of northwest Dallas, Texas (USA). It covers 205 acres (0.83 km2) in northwest Dallas and lies on the northwest boundary of Dallas Love Field in the airport's landing path. It was originally constructed in 1903 by damming Bachman Branch as a water source for Dallas, but it proved to be too small for their needs and was supplanted by White Rock Lake in 1911.\nToday, Bachman Lake is used as a recreational area. The lake and its surrounding park are generally well-kept, but the lake has recently been the subject of media interest over the development of an island in the middle.  Some attribute this island to poor construction management practices, while others blame normal sedimentation patterns. In either case, the City of Dallas has done nothing to remedy this problem, a source of criticism for the city. The area surrounding the lake is currently a hot bed of new construction. The Shops at Bluffview is a 260,000-square-foot (24,000 m2) upscale apartment, retail, restaurant and office development that is due for completion in 2008. There have been several 10,000 to 15,000 sf stylishly constructed retail centers built along the lake. At the Western end of the lake, DART Rail has begun construction on the new Orange line that will carry area residents to and from DFW airport. Bachman Station was opened as part of the Green Line's expansion in December 2010. A 3.3 miles (5.3 km) trail surrounds Bachman Lake and the lake is available for sailing and some fishing (the lake is stocked with catfish regularly - Stocking Schedule)."}}
