{"Troy": {"Chapel + Cultural Center at Rensselaer": "The Chapel + Cultural Center at Rensselaer is an architecturally unique, multipurpose performing arts and spiritual space in Troy, New York, owned and operated by the Rensselaer Newman Foundation (RNF). It is conventionally referred to as \"The C+CC\"; the \"+\" sign has come to be formally used instead of \"and\" or an ampersand as a representative symbol of the Christian cross. While located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and committed to serving both RPI's constituents and the surrounding community, the C+CC is managed and operated as an independent organizational entity."}}
