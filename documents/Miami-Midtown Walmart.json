{"Miami": {"Midtown Walmart": "Midtown Walmart is a controversial proposal by Walmart to build a 203,000-square-foot (18,900 m2) supercenter location on a 4.6-acre (1.9-hectare) site in the planned sub-district of Midtown Miami in the city of Miami, Florida, USA.\nThe proposal never met local regulations because Walmart never owned all of the land upon which it planned to build, yet they fought a five year fight to build on land they didn't own and the City strangely violated all of its laws to help make that happen.\nWalmart's Midtown plan was rejected the first time in February 2013, but was redesigned by Gensler and approved by Miami Planning and Zoning Director Francisco Garcia in August 2013, then upheld on appeal by the City Commission in November 2013. Midtown Walmart faced public and political opposition from area residents, business owners, and community activists after being poorly adapted to meet strict zoning regulations that resulted in the design differing slightly from the typical layout, such as utilizing second story roof parking versus a surface lot with more street liner retail spaces instead of a totally blank wall perimeter."}}
