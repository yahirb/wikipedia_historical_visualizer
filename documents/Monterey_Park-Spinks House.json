{"Monterey_Park": {"Spinks House": "The Spinks House, also known as Margaret B. S. Clapham Spinks House, (constructed 1908 - 1909) is a restored example of a California bungalow in Pasadena, California, USA. The house and grounds were designed by Henry Mather Greene of the architectural firm Greene and Greene as a home for Margaret B. S. Clapham Spinks and the retired judge William Ward Spinks.\n\n\n== Design ==\nDesigned and built as a permanent home for retired judge William Ward Spinks, who had recently moved to Southern California from Victoria, Canada, the three-story (plus basement) Spinks House is a classic example of a California bungalow built during America's Arts and Crafts movement. Though a far simpler version of such a house than its more grandiose, up-the-street neighbor, the Blacker House, its style shows influence from traditional Japanese aesthetics and a certain California spaciousness born of available land and a permissive climate."}}
