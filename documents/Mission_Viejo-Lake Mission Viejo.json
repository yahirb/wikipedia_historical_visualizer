{"Mission_Viejo": {"Lake Mission Viejo": "Lake Mission Viejo is a reservoir created for recreation in Mission Viejo, Orange County, California. The reservoir is formed by an earthfill dam across the canyon of Oso Creek, which is part of the Trabuco Creek and San Juan Creek drainage basin. The lake is not fed by urban runoff; it is maintained so as to be safe for contact."}}
