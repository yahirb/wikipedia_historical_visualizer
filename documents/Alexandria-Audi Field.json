{"Alexandria": {"Audi Field": "Audi Field is a soccer-specific stadium under construction in Buzzard Point in Washington, D.C. It will be the home stadium for the D.C. United team of Major League Soccer, and will seat 20,000 people. Previously, D.C. United had explored sites in the Washington metropolitan area. Following the failure of an initial stadium proposal in 2006, D.C. United made two additional stadium proposals that also failed to be built."}}
