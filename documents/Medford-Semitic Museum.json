{"Medford": {"Semitic Museum": "The Harvard Semitic Museum was founded in 1889, and moved into its present location at 6 Divinity Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1903.\nFrom the beginning, it was the home of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, a departmental library, a repository for research collections, a public educational institute, and a center for archaeological exploration. Among the museum's early achievements were the first scientific excavations in the Holy Land (at Samaria in 1907\u20131912) and excavations at Nuzi and Tell el-Khaleifeh in the Sinai, where the earliest alphabet was found."}}
