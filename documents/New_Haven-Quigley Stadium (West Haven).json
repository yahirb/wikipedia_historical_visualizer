{"New_Haven": {"Quigley Stadium (West Haven)": "Quigley Stadium is a stadium in West Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was originally built in 1947 from surplus bleachers that were once installed on flat bed light rail cars and towed alongside the Yale crew team as they competed off of nearby Orange Avenue. Maurice P. Quigley purchased these surplus bleachers off the rail cars and had them hauled approximately 1 mile to the current site which gave the field a capacity of 2,000 people."}}
