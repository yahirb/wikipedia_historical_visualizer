{"Rochester": {"IBM Rochester": "IBM Rochester is the facility of IBM in Rochester, Minnesota, not to be confused with the IBM Global Services facility in Rochester, New York. The initial structure was designed by Eero Saarinen, who clad the structure in blue panels of varying hues after being inspired by the Minnesota sky, as well as IBM's nickname of \"Big Blue\". These features and the facility's size has earned it the nickname \"The Big Blue Zoo\" from employees."}}
