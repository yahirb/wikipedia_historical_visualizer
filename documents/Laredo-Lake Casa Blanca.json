{"Laredo": {"Lake Casa Blanca": "Lake Casa Blanca is a reservoir on the Chacon Creek, 5 miles (8 km) northeast of downtown Laredo, Texas, United States. The reservoir was formed in 1951 by the construction of a dam to provide recreational opportunities for the residents of Webb County. The current dam is the second built across the creek - a previous dam built in 1946 failed the following year during the initial attempted impounding of a reservoir."}}
