{"Cincinnati": {"Waldvogel Viaduct": "The Waldvogel Viaduct, also called the Waldvogel Memorial Viaduct, was a bridge on the west side of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, connecting the Sixth Street Expressway with River Road (U.S. 50), Elberon Avenue and Warsaw Avenue. The section of Cincinnati is known as Lower Price Hill.\nThis viaduct was built to manage automobile traffic and avoid intersecting railroad lines, in order that grade crossings would not be required when the Cincinnati Union Terminal was constructed in 1933."}}
