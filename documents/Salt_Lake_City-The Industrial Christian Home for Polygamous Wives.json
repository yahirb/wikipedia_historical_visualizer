{"Salt_Lake_City": {"The Industrial Christian Home for Polygamous Wives": "The Industrial Christian Home for Polygamous Wives (or The Industrial Christian Home) was a women's refuge created in 1886 in Salt Lake City. Due to several conflicts, including low occupancy, the facility closed in 1893. The building was subsequently used as the seat of the Utah State Legislature; as a hotel; as officer's quarters in WW2 and then finally as a private club until it was demolished in 1985."}}
