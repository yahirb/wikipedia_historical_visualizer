{"Bartlett": {"Nashoba Community": "The Nashoba Community was an experimental project of Frances \"Fanny\" Wright, initiated in 1825 to educate and emancipate slaves. It was located in a 2,000-acre (8 km\u00b2) woodland on the side of present-day Germantown, Tennessee, a Memphis suburb, along the Wolf River. It was a small-scale test of her full-compensation emancipation plan in which no slaveholders would lose money for emancipating slaves."}}
