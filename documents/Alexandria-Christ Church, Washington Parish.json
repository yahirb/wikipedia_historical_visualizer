{"Alexandria": {"Christ Church, Washington Parish": "Christ Church \u2014 known also as Christ Church, Washington Parish or Christ Church on Capitol Hill \u2014 is a historic Episcopal church located at 620 G Street SE in Washington, D.C., USA. The church is also called Christ Church, Navy Yard, because of its proximity to the Washington Navy Yard and the U.S. Marine Barracks nearby (such that the neighborhood is sometimes called \"Barracks Row\").\nBuilt in 1807 in Gothic Revival style, the church began as one of two parish churches of Washington Parish, which the Maryland General Assembly created in 1794. The current building, built after the American Civil War, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969."}}
