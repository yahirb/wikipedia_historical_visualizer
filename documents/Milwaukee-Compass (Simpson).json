{"Milwaukee": {"Compass (Simpson)": "Compass is a public art work by American artist Gail Simpson, located on the east side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The painted alumnium sculpture was commissioned by the Eastside Business Improvement District #20 to serve as a gateway for pedestrians and vehicular traffic entering the North Avenue commercial zone. A tall stainless steel light post salvaged from the demolition of Milwaukee's Park East Freeway is surrounded by a colorful array of painted aluminum signs that protrude in a spiral formation."}}
