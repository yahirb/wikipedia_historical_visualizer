{"Worcester": {"Andrew Friberg Three-Decker": "The Andrew Friberg Three-Decker is a historic triple decker at 26 Ames Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built about 1928, during the last major phase of development in the city's Vernon Hill area. When the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was noted for its Colonial Revival styling, including porches supported by Tuscan columns and banded decorative shingling between the floors."}}
