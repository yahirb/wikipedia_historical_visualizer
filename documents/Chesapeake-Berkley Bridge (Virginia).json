{"Chesapeake": {"Berkley Bridge (Virginia)": "The Interstate 264 Berkley Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge that crosses the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, Virginia, United States. It carries Interstate 264 (I-264), U.S. Route 460 Alternate (US 460 Alt.), and State Route 337 (SR 337) across the river, connecting the Berkley neighborhood south of the river with downtown Norfolk to the north. The toll-free facility is one of only a small number of movable bridges on the Interstate Highway System, and is the first of two in the Hampton Roads region, predating the High Rise Bridge."}}
