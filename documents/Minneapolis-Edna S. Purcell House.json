{"Minneapolis": {"Edna S. Purcell House": "The Edna S. Purcell house (now known as the Purcell\u2013Cutts House) was designed by the firm of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie for architect William Purcell and his family in 1913. It is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nThe dwelling is a notable example of Prairie School architecture, featuring a long, narrow floor plan that disregards Victorian concepts about room divisions."}}
