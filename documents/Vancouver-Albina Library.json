{"Vancouver": {"Albina Library": "The Albina Library is a branch of the Multnomah County Library, located in northeast Portland, Oregon. The library's origins date back to 1906 with the establishment of a small reading room that housed 100 books. The branch has relocated three times since then, moving from the building which now houses The Title Wave Used Bookstore to a retail plaza in northeast Portland."}}
