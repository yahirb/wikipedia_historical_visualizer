{"New_York": {"Duane Park": "Duane Park is a small, triangular public urban park located in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The park is bordered by Hudson Street to the east and branches of Duane Street on north and south sides.\nThe park is supported by a non-profit group, The Friends of Duane Park, whose website contains a brief history of the park and its neighborhood.\nThe city of New York purchased Duane Park in 1795 from Trinity Church for five dollars. The park is surrounded by commercial buildings which were constructed during the 19th century. Duane Street, which borders the park, is named for James Duane, an important parishioner at Trinity Church."}}
