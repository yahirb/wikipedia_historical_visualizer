{"Henderson": {"Ethel M Botanical Cactus Garden": "Ethel M Botanical Cactus Gardens is a 3-acre (1.2 ha) botanical garden located at the Ethel M Chocolate Factory, 2 Cactus Garden Drive, Henderson, Nevada. The gardens, and the factory itself, are open to the public with no admission charge.\nThe Botanical Cactus Gardens also include a \"Living Machine\", their name for a demonstration waste water treatment facility. Using bacteria, algae, protozoa, snails and fish, the facility recycles 100 percent of the chocolate factory's waste water without the use of any chemicals. The water is recycled for use in providing water for the gardens. The ponds from the waste water facility attract many of the birds that inhabit the gardens.\nThroughout the year the Botanical Cactus Gardens are host to several community events including the annual cactus garden lighting. The cactus garden holiday lights show is hosted in November and December and is free to the general public."}}
