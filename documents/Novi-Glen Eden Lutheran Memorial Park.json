{"Novi": {"Glen Eden Lutheran Memorial Park": "Glen Eden Lutheran Memorial Park is a non-profit cemetery in Livonia, Michigan and Macomb Township. Glen Eden began serving the community when a small group of investors started the cemetery in 1929. In 1932, a twist of fate transferred ownership and operation of the cemetery to four Lutheran churches."}}
