{"Miami_Beach": {"Ralston Building": "The Ralston Building, now known as the Carrion Jewelry Center, is a historic building located in Downtown Miami. At the time of its completion in 1917, the eight story building was the tallest building in Miami, a title it held for less than one year when it was surpassed by the McAllister Hotel, built later in 1917. In 2001, it was purchased by First & First Investments, a company owned by local jeweler Juan Perez-Carrion."}}
