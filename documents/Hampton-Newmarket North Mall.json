{"Hampton": {"Newmarket North Mall": "Newmarket North Mall was a mall located in Hampton, Virginia that was developed by The Hahn Company and opened in 1975. Its three anchors were Leggett, Miller & Rhoads, and Sears.\nIn 1989, Goodman Segar Hogan bought the property and began a two-year, $9 million renovation and expansion project. In 1990, when the renovation was nearly complete, the mall was renamed \"Newmarket Fair.\"\nDue to Patrick Henry Mall's opening in bordering Newport News, Virginia in 1987, Newmarket Fair languished, and to this day Sears is the only remaining retail anchor tenant.\nIn 2000, Washington, D.C.-based companies NetCenter Partners and Hampton Partners purchased the 900,000-square-foot (84,000 m2) property on 53 acres (210,000 m2) and converted it into a business center with supporting retail, personal services and food service amenities called NetCenter."}}
