{"Hoboken": {"New York Dream Center": "The LA Dream Center, under the leadership of Pastor Matthew Barnett, planted the New York Dream Center in the summer of 2008. Pastor Brad Reed and his wife, Stella, were both part of the LA Dream Center's leadership for over ten years before they moved their family to New York City to become the lead pastors of the New York Dream Center. The Dream Center provides hope by meeting both the tangible and spiritual needs of those in New York City communities."}}
