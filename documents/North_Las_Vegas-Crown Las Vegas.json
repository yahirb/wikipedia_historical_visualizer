{"North_Las_Vegas": {"Crown Las Vegas": "Crown Las Vegas, previously known as the Las Vegas Tower, was a proposed supertall skyscraper that would have been built on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. If built, the tower would have been 1,887 feet (575 m) tall, making it the tallest building in the United States and 5th tallest in the world. After two major redesigns, the project was cancelled in March 2008."}}
