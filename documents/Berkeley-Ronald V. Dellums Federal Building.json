Dellums Federal Building complex is a federal building complex in Oakland, California, constructed as part of the Oakland City Center redevelopment project. In 1998, the United States Congress passed a bill naming the building for former mayor and Congressman Ronald V. Dellums. It consists of two identical towers topped with pyramid-shaped roofs, echoing similar landmarks such as the Alameda County Courthouse."}}
