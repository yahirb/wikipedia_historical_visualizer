{"Cleveland": {"Wade Park (Cleveland park)": "Wade Park is a park in the University Circle neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. Wade Park today largely serves as the campus for the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Botanical Garden, and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, as well as Wade Lagoon, which faces the Museum of Art from the south end of the park. Though not technically a historical landmark itself, the park falls within the eponymous Wade Park historical district and serves as a backdrop for most of its registered buildings."}}
