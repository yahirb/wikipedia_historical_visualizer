{"Kansas_City": {"Imperial Brewing Company Brewery": "The Imperial Brewing Company Brewery is an abandoned Late Victorian/Romanesque Revival-style industrial site located at 2825 Southwest Boulevard in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Built in 1902, the surviving brewhouse and stable were part of a larger complex developed by Ludwig D. Breitag, a German immigrant and stone contractor. An icehouse and other buildings in the complex were demolished when the site was converted to a flour mill during Prohibition."}}
