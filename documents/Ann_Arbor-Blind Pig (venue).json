{"Ann_Arbor": {"Blind Pig (venue)": "The Blind Pig is a music venue in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In one popular definition, the name comes from a slang term used to refer to police officers who had been bribed to ignore illegal speakeasy establishments in the days of prohibition.\nThe club was established as a home for blues musicians, although today it books predominantly 'indie' rock acts and local groups."}}
