{"Honolulu": {"Salt Lake, Hawaii": "Salt Lake is a neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii on the island of O\u2018ahu. The area is also known as \u0100liamanu after a nearby crater, although Salt Lake itself is in a crater called \u0100lia pa\u2018akai \u2014 meaning \"salt pond\" in the Hawaiian language. The Salt Lake community was developed in the 1960s during a construction boom, providing residents with an expansive view of downtown Honolulu and the sugarcane plantations of the central plain of O\u2018ahu."}}
