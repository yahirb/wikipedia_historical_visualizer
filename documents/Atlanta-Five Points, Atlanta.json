{"Atlanta": {"Five Points, Atlanta": "Five Points is a district of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, the primary reference for the downtown area.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe name refers to the convergence of Marietta Street, Edgewood Avenue, Decatur Street, and two legs of Peachtree Street (the south-southwestern leg was originally Whitehall Street, before a section of Whitehall was renamed as an extension of Peachtree Street to give businesses south of Five Points the prestige of a Peachtree Street address). Five Points is usually considered by Atlantans to be the center of town, and it is the origin of the street addressing system for the city and county, although four of the streets (except Edgewood) are rotated at least 30\u00b0 clockwise from their nominal directions, along with the rest of the downtown street grid."}}
