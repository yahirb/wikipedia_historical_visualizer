{"Medford": {"Snug Gables": "Snug Gables is a historic house built for Thomas Dreier by Frank Chouteau Brown in Winchester, MA.\nIt was built in 1920 and named after Dreier's wife, Blanche \"Snug\" Drier. Dreier ran the \"Thomas Dreier Service\" out of a print shop in the basement, which distributed advertising publications and motivational short stories to area business leaders. After Brown completed a project in 1923 to improve the grounds, it was featured in the August 1923 US edition of what was then known as Country Life Magazine."}}
