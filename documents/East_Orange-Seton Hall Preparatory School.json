{"East_Orange": {"Seton Hall Preparatory School": "Seton Hall Preparatory School, generally called Seton Hall Prep or \"The Prep\", is a Roman Catholic all boys' high school located in the suburban community of West Orange in Essex County, New Jersey, operating under the supervision of the Archdiocese of Newark. Founded in 1856 with an original enrollment of five boys, Seton Hall Prep was originally located on the campus of Seton Hall University where it became commonly known as \"The Prep\" as a way to distinguish it from \"The University.\" In 1985, The Prep moved to its present location which was, at the time, West Orange High School. Seton Hall is the oldest Catholic college preparatory school in New Jersey."}}
