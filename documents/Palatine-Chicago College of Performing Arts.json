{"Palatine": {"Chicago College of Performing Arts": "Chicago College of Performing Arts or CCPA is a performing arts college that is housed at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Illinois. While CCPA is officially a part of Roosevelt University, CCPA (both the institution and its students) has its own distinct personality. The relationship between the two is much like that of the Eastman School of Music and The University of Rochester or The College-Conservatory of Music and the University of Cincinnati."}}
