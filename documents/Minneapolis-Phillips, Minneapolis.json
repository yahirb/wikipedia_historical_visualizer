{"Minneapolis": {"Phillips, Minneapolis": "Phillips is a community in Minneapolis, just south of downtown. Phillips is a diverse area in many ways: its population includes people of many nationalities; it has a mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses; and it is home to several large employers such as Abbott Northwestern Hospital, Wells Fargo Mortgage and Allina Health Care Services along with small neighborhood businesses. Traditionally, it was both a community and a neighborhood (in Minneapolis, a neighborhood is a subdivision of a community)."}}
