{"Cincinnati": {"The Banks": "The Banks is the name given to the current mixed-use project being developed on the land between Paul Brown Stadium and Great American Ball Park along the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction for a new riverfront area between the two stadiums is the result of a public participation planning process begun in October 1996. Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati engaged Urban Design Associates to prepare a plan to give direction in two public policy areas:\nTo site the two new stadiums for the Cincinnati Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals\nTo develop an overall urban design framework for the development of the central riverfront which would capitalize on the major public investment in the stadiums and structured parking."}}
