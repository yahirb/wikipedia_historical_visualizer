{"Brockton": {"North Easton (MBTA station)": "North Easton is a proposed railroad station on the MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton Line located in North Easton, Massachusetts and Stoughton, Massachusetts. It is proposed to built as part of the state's effort to extend rail service to Fall River and New Bedford. It would be located well to the north of the old station in North Easton, itself to become Easton Village station one stop southwards on the new line to New Bedford and Fall River."}}
