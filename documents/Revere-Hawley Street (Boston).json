{"Revere": {"Hawley Street (Boston)": "Hawley Street of Boston, Massachusetts, is located in the Financial District between Milk and Summer Streets. Prior to 1799, it was called Bishop's Alley and briefly in the 1790s Board Alley.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\nAccording to historian Annie Haven Thwing, in 1645 the path that later would become Hawley Street was \"laid out through the gardens towards the south windmill, between the houses of Amos Richardson and John Palmer on Summer Street.\" In the 17th century people referred to it as \"'the lane in which the house of Gilbert the tanner stands,' 'a little lane formerly called Gilbert's lane.'\"\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nAfter 1728, the lane was \"a path through a pasture made by the worshippers of Trinity Church, who lived in King Street.\" Because the terrain consisted of a marshy bog, wooden planks were laid down to facilitate travel, and so it was referred to as \"Board Alley.\"\nIn 1792, theatre enthusiasts organized an illegal theatre, the Board Alley Theatre, also called the \"New Exhibition Room.\" With mixed popular opinion, governor John Hancock shut it down in June 1793."}}
