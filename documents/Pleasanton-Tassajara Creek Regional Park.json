{"Pleasanton": {"Tassajara Creek Regional Park": "Tassajara Creek Regional Park (TCRP) is a park near Dublin in the U.S. state of California, which has been called one of the most obscure parks in the East Bay Regional Park System. It is located adjacent to the eastern boundary of Camp Parks and was established in 1991 as a staging facility for the Tassajara Creek Regional Trail. Because of TCRP's small size\u201427 acres (11 ha)\u2014and the existence of a security fence along the Camp Parks boundary, usage of the park by both humans and wildlife is limited."}}
