{"New_Haven": {"Heroes Tunnel": "Heroes Tunnel (formerly West Rock Tunnel) is a 1,200-foot-long (370 m), twin-tube tunnel carrying Route 15 (Wilbur Cross Parkway) through West Rock Ridge in New Haven, Connecticut. Opened in 1949, it was said to be the only vehicular tunnel \"to pass beneath a land feature\" in Connecticut and all of New England. However, this statement is not accurate as there are other vehicular tunnels in New England."}}
