{"Somerville": {"Grace Hopkinson Eliot Hall": "Grace Hopkinson Eliot Hall, often called Eliot Hall, is an historic dormitory building on the Radcliffe Quadrangle of Harvard University at 51 Shepard Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The four story neo-Georgian brick building was built in 1907 to a design by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr. It is a duplicate of Bertram Hall, which is adjacent, except some of its architectural details were simplified to reduce costs."}}
