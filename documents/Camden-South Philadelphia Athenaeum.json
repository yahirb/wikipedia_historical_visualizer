{"Camden": {"South Philadelphia Athenaeum": "The South Philadelphia Athenaeum was one of the most important not-for-profit venues in Philadelphia during its existence, an open forum where events ranging from weekly philosophy and mathematics lectures, to fashion, art, game, puppet, magic, comedy and musical shows would be free to the public. It operated from circa spring 2004 to September 24, 2005.\n\"The Anthenaeum\", more commonly called the \"Juniper Warehouse\", is associated with other members of Philadelphia's independent art scene including Space 1026, Vox Populi, The Fabric Workshop and Museum and Black Floor Gallery."}}
