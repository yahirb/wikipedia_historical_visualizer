{"Santa_Clarita": {"Albert Einstein Academy for Letters, Arts and Sciences": "Albert Einstein Academy for Letters, Arts, and Sciences, also known as AEA, was a public charter school in the Hart district, located in the Santa Clarita Valley in California, United States. It was decided by the Hart Board of Education that the charter for AEA was not to be renewed. This closure was due to a mismanagement of money and the opening up of schools for which the founders could not support."}}
