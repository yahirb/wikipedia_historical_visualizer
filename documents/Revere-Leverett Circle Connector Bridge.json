{"Revere": {"Leverett Circle Connector Bridge": "The Leverett Circle Connector Bridge is a highway bridge over the Charles River, carrying two lanes each of northbound and southbound traffic. It connects to Interstate 93 in Somerville, Massachusetts (the \"Northern Expressway\") at the north end and splits at the south end, providing direct access to both Storrow Drive and Leverett Circle in Boston. The span was built in conjunction with the more dramatic Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge as part of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, widely known as the Big Dig."}}
