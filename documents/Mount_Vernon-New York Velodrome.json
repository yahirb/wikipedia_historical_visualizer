{"Mount_Vernon": {"New York Velodrome": "The New York Velodrome was a state-of-the-art bicycle track at 225th Street, between Exterior Street and Broadway within the Kingsbridge and Kingsbridge Heights neighborhoods of the Bronx. It bordered the Marble Hill neighborhood. After the surrounding of Marble Hill was filled in and merged to the Bronx or the mainland, the space filled in became part of Kingsbridge."}}
