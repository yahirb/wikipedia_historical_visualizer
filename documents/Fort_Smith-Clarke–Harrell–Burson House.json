{"Fort_Smith": {"Clarke\u2013Harrell\u2013Burson House": "The Clarke\u2013Harrell\u2013Burson House is a historic house at 603 Parkview in Van Buren, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure with Greek Revival styling, built about 1841, and is believed to have been the first non-log house built in the area known as Logtown that is now part of the city of Van Buren. The house is locally notable for several prominent residents: George Washington Clarke was the publisher of Arkansas's first newspaper west of Little Rock, the Intelligencer, which began publication in 1842 and was taken over by Clarke in 1844."}}
