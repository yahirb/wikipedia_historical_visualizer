{"Tacoma": {"Nihongo Gakko (Tacoma)": "The Nihon Go Gakko (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5b66\u6821, Nihongo gakk\u014d, literally, Japanese Language School) alternately, Nihon Gogakko, in what was then Tacoma, Washington's Japantown, was one of 24 Japanese language schools that existed in Washington prior to World War II.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was built in 1922 to replace a smaller building and accommodate a larger enrollment. It was designed by Frederick Heath of Heath, Gove and Bell. Because Washington had laws preventing aliens from owning land, the lot was paid for by a school corporation that was made up of three Americans, and two Issei Japanese Americans."}}
