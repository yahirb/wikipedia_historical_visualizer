{"Bellingham": {"Chuckanut Mountains": "The Chuckanut Mountains (from \"Chuckanut\", a native word for \"Long beach far from a narrow entrance\"), or Chuckanuts, are located on the northern Washington state coast of the Salish Sea, just south of Bellingham, Washington. Being a part of the Cascade Range, they are the only place where the Cascades come west down to meet the sea. The Chuckanuts are considered to be a part of the Puget Lowland Forest Ecoregion."}}
