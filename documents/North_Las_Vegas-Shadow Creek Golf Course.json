{"North_Las_Vegas": {"Shadow Creek Golf Course": "Shadow Creek is an 18-hole golf course in North Las Vegas, Nevada, designed by Tom Fazio and built by Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt from empty desert flatland on a 350-acre (140 ha) site, it cost a reported sixty million dollars. During construction, over three million cubic yards of dirt was dug up from the desert floor and pushed around the perimeter, creating a berm that blocked any view from the outside."}}
