{"New_Bedford": {"Jewish Cemetery of New Bedford": "The Jewish Cemetery of New Bedford, Massachusetts is located in the far north of the city, on Old Plainville Road, just north of New Bedford Regional Airport. The cemetery was established in 1898 as the principal burying ground for two congregations, Chesed Shel Emes and Ahavath Achim. It is the second Jewish cemetery in the city; the first, a small section of Peckham West Cemetery, was filled up in the 1890s."}}
