{"Atlanta": {"Slabtown (Atlanta)": "Slabtown or Slab Town was a red-light district established in Atlanta in the 1840s, and located off Decatur Street (on the present site of Grady Memorial Hospital).\nThe area was largely built with slabs from Jonathan Norcross's sawmill.. This wicked development was of great annoyance to the good citizens of Atlanta, as crimes were often committed there, and many of the young men fell into bad habits from frequenting Slab Town."}}
