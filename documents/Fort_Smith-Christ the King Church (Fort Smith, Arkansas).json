{"Fort_Smith": {"Christ the King Church (Fort Smith, Arkansas)": "The Christ the King Church is a historic church building at Greenwood and South \"S\" Streets in Fort Smith, Arkansas. It is a Mission/Spanish revival style church built out of native fieldstone in 1930 to a design by Thompson, Sanders & Ginocchio. It is an architecturally distinctive example of the work of noted Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson, with transepts located near the front of the building (instead of the more traditional rear), and the angled parapet leading to the open belltower."}}
