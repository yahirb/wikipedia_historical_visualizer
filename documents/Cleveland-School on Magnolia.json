{"Cleveland": {"School on Magnolia": "The School on Magnolia was an alternative high school in Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded in 1970 as the Friends School in Cleveland, and its association with the Religious Society of Friends continued through 1975, at which point the local Friends meeting decided that the school was no longer fully carrying out the mission of a Quaker school. The change was amicable, and the school was renamed The School on Magnolia, after its location in a large old house at 10819 Magnolia Drive in the University Circle section of Cleveland."}}
