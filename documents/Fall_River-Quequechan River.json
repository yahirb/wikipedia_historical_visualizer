{"Fall_River": {"Quequechan River": "The Quequechan River is a river in Fall River, Massachusetts, that flows in a northwesterly direction from the northwest corner of the South Watuppa Pond through the heart of the city of Fall River and into the end of the Taunton River at Mount Hope Bay at Heritage State Park/Battleship Cove. The word Quequechan means \"Falling River\" or \"Leaping/Falling Waters\" in Wampanoag, hence the city's name.\nThe river is 2.7 miles (4.3 km)  and is mostly placid and stagnant in certain places, until it nears downtown Fall River near City Hall, where a quickly declining grade causes it to turn rapid down the hill into Mount Hope Bay/Taunton River."}}
