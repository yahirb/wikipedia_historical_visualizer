{"Revere": {"Province House (Boston, Massachusetts)": "The Province House (1679\u20131864) was a 17th-century mansion on old Marlborough Street in Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1679, it was the home of merchant Peter Sergeant, and after 1716, the official residence of royal governors of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Known for its great main staircase and original Tudor-style chimney stacks, the building fell into disrepair in the 19th century, partially burned in 1864, and was demolished in 1922."}}
