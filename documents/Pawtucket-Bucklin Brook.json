{"Pawtucket": {"Bucklin Brook": "Bucklin Brook was a brook in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It was 3 miles long and was at one time the source of drinking water for the city from a reservoir that was located at present day McCoy Stadium. The upper portion of the stream up to the stadium was buried in the 1930s to make room for development."}}
