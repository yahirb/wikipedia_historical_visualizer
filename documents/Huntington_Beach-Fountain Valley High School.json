{"Huntington_Beach": {"Fountain Valley High School": "Fountain Valley High School (FVHS) is a public high school in Fountain Valley, California. It was established in 1966 and is a part of the Huntington Beach Union High School District. It is notable for its rivalry with Edison High School, particularly during football season, in which both schools compete in the \"Battle of the Bell.\"\nThe athletic teams are known as the Barons, and the school colors are blue and gold. The school had to renovate some of its buildings, which were sinking, starting in 2002. These renovations yielded new portable buildings in an area which was previously a parking lot. As of 2006, these semi-permanent portable buildings have been removed and replaced with permanent facilities. In March 2011, the track and football field were renovated. The dirt track has been replaced by a synthetic track and the field has been replaced with new natural grass. Years later, however, the field had been replaced by imitation grass and turf.\nFor the first few years after opening, Fountain Valley High School had a larger student population than any other high school West of the Mississippi. Many universities look to FVHS for sports. A scene from the 1997 film Wag the Dog during a basketball game was filmed at FVHS during Fall 1996 and utilized the 1997 graduating class as extras.\nIn March 2005, the Fountain Valley High School drumline and band was filmed in Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" music video.\nIn April 2007, Fountain Valley High School was recognized as a California Distinguished School for the second consecutive time."}}
