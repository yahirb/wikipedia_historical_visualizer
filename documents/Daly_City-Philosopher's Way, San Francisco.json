{"Daly_City": {"Philosopher's Way, San Francisco": "Philosopher's Way, San Francisco is a 2.7-mile (4.3 km) loop trail around the perimeter of John McLaren Park created by artists Peter Richards and Susan Schwartzenberg, staff artists at the Exploratorium. The trail, dedicated on January 5, 2013, is the first and only path built for philosophers in the United States and features fourteen stone markers by mason George Gonzalez intended as \"musing stations\" to stimulate contemplation. The US$146,000 (equivalent to $153,000 in 2017) trail was funded as a public art set-aside by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, and offers views of Mount Diablo, Mount Tamalpais, Angel Island, and the Pacific Ocean on a clear day."}}
