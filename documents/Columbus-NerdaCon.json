{"Columbus": {"NerdaCon": "NerdaCon is a multi-genre fan convention (first seen as a \"gaming, popular arts, and crafts convention\") held annually since 2007 at Columbus State University by the school's Campus Nerds group, a campus organization that describes itself as \"an organization that embraces all special interests and gives its members a community of like minded invidiviuals\". Each year, the con is titled \"NerdaCon vX\", where \"X\" is the number of the con (The first was \"v1\", the second was \"v2\", etc.). As it is a multi-genre convention, it has no general focus other than that of the Nerds, in that the panels, guests, and dealers each add a focus toward anime, manga, science fiction, gaming, comic books, zombie apocalypse, or a combination of these or other generally nerdy or geeky things to add to the atmosphere."}}
