{"Peoria": {"Kickapoo Building": "The Kickapoo Building is a historic commercial building located at 726 West Main Street in Peoria, Illinois. Built in 1911, the building was originally used as a tied house for the Anheuser-Busch Brewery, which sought to expand its presence in Peoria's large brewing industry. The two-story building has a flatiron shape, a design which took advantage of its triangular lot."}}
