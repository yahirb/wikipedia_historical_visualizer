{"Carson": {"Rancho de los Palos Verdes": "Rancho Palos Verdes (also known by the abbreviation RPV) is a city in Los Angeles County, California atop the Palos Verdes Hills and bluffs of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. An affluent suburb of Los Angeles, it is known for large tracts of open space and expansive views of the Pacific Ocean. Rancho Palos Verdes is translated as \"Ranch of Green Sticks\", probably referring to the willows in the northeastern part of Bixby Slough (now known as Machado Lake) shown on earlier maps."}}
