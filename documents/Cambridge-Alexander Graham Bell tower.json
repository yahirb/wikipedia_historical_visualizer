{"Cambridge": {"Alexander Graham Bell tower": "The Alexander Graham Bell tower refers to a planned 375-foot (114 m) tower that would have been constructed at Boston University as a tribute to former faculty member Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone while at the university. Intended to sit behind Marsh Chapel on the Charles River, the Collegiate Gothic masonry spire was to be modeled on the tower of St. Botolph's Church in Boston, England, the town from which Boston, Massachusetts takes its name."}}
