{"Glendale": {"Bronson Canyon": "Bronson Canyon, or Bronson Caves, is a section of Griffith Park in Los Angeles that has become known as a filming location for many movies and TV shows, especially westerns and science fiction, from the early days of motion pictures to the present. Its craggy and remote-looking setting, but easily accessible location, has made it a prime choice for filmmakers, particularly of low-budget films, who want to place scenes in a lonely wilderness.\n\n\n== Location and history ==\nBronson Canyon is located in the southwest section of Griffith Park, and thus is easily accessible from Hollywood."}}
