{"Worcester": {"William Hogg House": "The William Hogg House is an historic house at 54 Elm Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The house was first built in 1853 as the Rice House and was significantly altered (technically qualifying as a renovation rather than as a new structure) according to plans by Fuller & Delano. Its front facade has a Corinthian porch sheltering a center entry flanked by bay windows."}}
