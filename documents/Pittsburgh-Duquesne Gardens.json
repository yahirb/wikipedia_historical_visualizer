{"Pittsburgh": {"Duquesne Gardens": "The Duquesne Gardens was the main sports arena located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the first half of the 20th century. Built in 1890, the building originally served as a trolley barn, before becoming a multi-purpose arena. The Gardens opened 3 years after a fire destroyed the city's prior sports arena, the Schenley Park Casino, in 1896."}}
