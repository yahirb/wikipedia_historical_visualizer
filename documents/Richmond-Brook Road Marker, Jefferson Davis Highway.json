{"Richmond": {"Brook Road Marker, Jefferson Davis Highway": "The Brook Road Marker, Jefferson Davis Highway is a commemorative marker on the Jefferson Davis Highway, in Henrico County, Virginia, outside of Richmond, Virginia. The Jefferson Davis Highway was conceived and marked by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, as a counter to the Lincoln Highway in the north, during 1913-1925. In that era, named highways were being marked as automobile travel increased, and the advent of numbered highways eventually loomed."}}
