{"Yonkers": {"South Schraalenburgh Church": "South Schraalenburgh Church, also known as South Presbyterian Church, was founded 1723 in Bergenfield, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States as a Dutch reformed church, as an alternative place of worship, as the nearest church was located in Hackensack. The square sanctuary was completed in 1728, with a new sanctuary (still currently in use) completed in 1799. Opposing elements within the congregation split with the mainstream and founded the North Schraalenburgh Reformed Church in 1801."}}
