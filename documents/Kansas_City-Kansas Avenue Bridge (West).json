{"Kansas_City": {"Kansas Avenue Bridge (West)": "The Kansas Avenue Bridge (West) is a four lane, multi-beam girder bridge crossing the Kansas River, and a small company on the east side. It was first built in 1916 as a 9 span thru-truss, but later in 1988 destroyed, and replaced with the current multi-beam girder bridge. It is just west of the 18th Street Expressway Bridge."}}
