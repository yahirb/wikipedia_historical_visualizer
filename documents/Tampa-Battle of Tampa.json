{"Tampa": {"Battle of Tampa": "The Battle of Tampa, also known as the \"Yankee Outrage at Tampa\", was a minor engagement of the American Civil War fought June 30 \u2013 July 1, 1862, between the United States Navy and a Confederate artillery company charged with protecting the port of Tampa, a small but notable trade hub for the Confederacy, now facing a full-scale Union naval blockade along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn April 13, 1862, at 11 a.m., the alarm went up when a Union schooner anchored behind an island two miles from Tampa. Confederate pickets were posted on all the roads into town to sound the alarm because it was feared the ship was a decoy."}}
