{"Colorado_Springs": {"Chidlaw Building": "The Chidlaw Building is a former United States Air Force facility located in the Knob Hill neighborhood of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The building associated, but not within the Ent Air Force Base complex, was leased by the military for several decades and was headquarters of several military commands, starting with the Air Defense Command (ADC) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). When Chidlaw was completed, personnel from multiple locations, including the Ent Air Force Base, were consolidated into the new building."}}
