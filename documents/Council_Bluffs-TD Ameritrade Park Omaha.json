{"Council_Bluffs": {"TD Ameritrade Park Omaha": "TD Ameritrade Park Omaha is a baseball park in Omaha, Nebraska, the home field of the College World Series since 2011. Opened earlier that year, the venue was constructed after the NCAA signed an agreement to keep the CWS in Omaha until at least 2035 if the ballpark was built. The event has been held in the city since 1950, previously at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium."}}
