{"Lynn": {"Elbridge Gerry House": "Elbridge Gerry (; July 17, 1744 (O.S. July 6, 1744) \u2013 November 23, 1814) was an American statesman and diplomat. As a Democratic-Republican he served as the fifth Vice President of the United States from March 1813 until his death in November 1814. He is known best for being the namesake of gerrymandering, a process by which electoral districts are drawn with the aim of aiding the party in power, although its initial \"g\" has recently softened to /d\u0292/ from the hard /\u0261/ of his name."}}
