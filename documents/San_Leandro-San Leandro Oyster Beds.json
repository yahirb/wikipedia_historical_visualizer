{"San_Leandro": {"San Leandro Oyster Beds": "The San Leandro Oyster Beds in San Leandro, California, were the origin of the oyster industry in the U.S. state of California. During the 1890s, the oyster industry thrived until it became the single most important fishery in the state. According to the description provided by the California Office of Historic Preservation, Moses Wicks is supposed to have been the first to bring seed oysters around Cape Horn and implant them in the San Leandro beds."}}
