The canal was filled in about 1950, but the lighthouse remained on a jetty extending into the lake on a half mile long stretch of the canal that was left and is still used as a small boat and yachting harbor.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original lighthouse was built in 1838 on a foundation of sheet piling filled in with shells."}}
