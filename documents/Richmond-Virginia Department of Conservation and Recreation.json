{"Richmond": {"Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation": "The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation is a department of the government of Virginia; it oversees all Virginia state parks and Natural Area Preserves.\nThe Virginia State Commission of Conservation and Development was created in 1926 under Governor Harry F. Byrd to consolidate and coordinate several conservation agencies: the Water Power and Development Commission, the State Geological Commission, the State Geological Survey, Office of the State Geologist, Office of the State Forester, and the Division of Parks. William E. Carson (1870-1942) was the Commission's first (unpaid) chairman and served until resigning pending a reorganization that became effective in late December 1934 and authorized a full-time state employee to head the agency."}}
