{"Lynn": {"Salem Harbor Power Station": "Salem Harbor Power Station, was a coal-fired power plant located in Salem, Massachusetts, U.S. It is slated to be replaced by a new gas-powered plant in June 2017, which will exist on a smaller footprint than the original plant, allowing the space to be used for future development. The 60-year-old station, which was purchased by Footprint Power in 2012, was brought offline on May 31, 2014. Demolition work was completed in 2016, while the new plant was being built around it."}}
