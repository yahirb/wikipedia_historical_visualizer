{"Milpitas": {"Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education": "The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education is a center of distinction at Santa Clara University. Since founding their first school in 1548, the Jesuits have always aimed to provide an education that forms students as whole persons who will change the world for the better. As one of Santa Clara University's three Centers of Distinction, the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances that distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara, through its five signature program: Bannan Institutes, The Thriving Neighbors Initiative, Arrupe Weekly Engagement, The Immersion Program, and Ignatian Spirituality offerings."}}
