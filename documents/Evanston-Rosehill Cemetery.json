{"Evanston": {"Rosehill Cemetery": "Rosehill Cemetery (founded 1864) is an American Victorian-era cemetery on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, and at 350 acres (1.4 km2), is the largest cemetery in the City of Chicago. The name \"Rosehill\" resulted from a City Clerk's error \u2013 the area was previously called \"Roe's Hill\", named for nearby farmer Hiram Roe. He refused to sell his land to the city until it was promised that the cemetery be named in his honor."}}
