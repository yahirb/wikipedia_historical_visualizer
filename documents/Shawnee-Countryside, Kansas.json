{"Shawnee": {"Countryside, Kansas": "Countryside was a half-mile-wide residential area in Johnson County, Kansas, USA, which was incorporated by its residents as a city in 1951 under Kansas Law, as a status statement. In a special election on December 3, 2002, residents voted to re-consolidate with the surrounding city of Mission, Kansas, in which the houses and street had originally been built beginning in 1937. Countryside, as a separate governmental entity, ceased to exist on January 15, 2003, although the neighborhood retains the name informally."}}
