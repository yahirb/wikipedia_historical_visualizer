{"Baltimore": {"Odd Fellows Hall (Baltimore, 1891)": "The Odd Fellows Hall in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, is a historic building that was the meeting place of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows fraternal organization, and is now an apartment building. It was built in 1891 and is a five bay structure featuring a central arched entrance with brownstone Romanesque columns and architraves. In the late 1970s, an adaptive reuse project retained most of its exterior architectural character while providing modern office space in the renovated interior."}}
