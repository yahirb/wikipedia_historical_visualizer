{"Wilmington": {"Swanwyck": "Swanwyck is a historic home located near New Castle in New Castle County, Delaware. It was built between 1813 and 1819, and is a two-story, three bay, stuccoed brick dwelling reflective of the Regency period. The house has been modified by later additions and is now surrounded by 20th century residential development, unlike its original farmland setting."}}
