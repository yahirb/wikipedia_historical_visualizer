{"Boston": {"South Bay Tower": "South Bay Tower, also known as the Gateway Center, is a proposed skyscraper planned for Boston, Massachusetts. If completed, South Bay Tower would stand as the tallest building in Boston, Massachusetts, and New England, surpassing the 60-story John Hancock Tower by 7 stories and at least 10 feet (3.0 m). The South Bay tower would be built on 10 acres (40,000 m2) of land off Hudson Street just south of Downtown Boston, in an area of Chinatown reclaimed following the conclusion of the Big Dig."}}
