{"Kirkland": {"Drumheller Fountain": "Drumheller Fountain, also known as Frosh Pond, is an outdoor fountain on the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington, in the United States. Geyser Basin, built for the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, was the predecessor to Drumheller Fountain. Its design and location were similar to the present-day fountain, but it was a distinct structure, and not in exactly the same location."}}
