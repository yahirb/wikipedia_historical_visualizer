{"Bayonne": {"Silver Lake, Staten Island": "Silver Lake is the name of both a reservoir and an adjacent neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island.\n\n\n== History ==\nLocated inside Silver Lake Park, the first city park to be established on Staten Island, Silver Lake in its current form was created in 1917 when water was piped in to fill it from the Ashokan Reservoir in Ulster County, New York, 119 miles (192 km) away. The water started arriving on October 25, and the reservoir would become the largest body of fresh water on Staten Island."}}
