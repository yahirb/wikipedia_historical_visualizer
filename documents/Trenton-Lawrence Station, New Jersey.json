{"Trenton": {"Lawrence Station, New Jersey": "Lawrence Station is an unincorporated community located within Lawrence Township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The settlement is named for a former railroad station on the Pennsylvania Railroad's New York Division line, now a part of the Northeast Corridor (though no trains currently stop here). Today, some wooded areas and buildings from the time of the station remain but more townhouse developments, cultural centers, and industrial facilities are located along the main road through the area, Lawrence Station Road (partly County Route 608)."}}
