{"Waltham": {"Town Diner": "The Deluxe Town Diner is an historic diner at 627 Mount Auburn Street in Watertown, Massachusetts.\nThis diner was manufactured on site, rather than having been prefabricated and shipped to the site from a specific diner manufacturer. In 1947, George Contos and his father built this diner around their earlier Worcester Lunch Car Company diner."}}
