{"Boston": {"Boston Stone": "The Boston Stone is a stone in Boston, Massachusetts. Near \u2014but not on\u2014 the Freedom Trail, it is a minor tourist attraction.\nThe stone, a flattened sphere about 2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter, hollowed out on one side, is embedded in the foundation of a building on Marshall Street (a narrow alley named for Thomas Marshall, captain of a ferry to Charlestown in the late 17th century) in the Blackstone Block Historic District. Below the stone is a plinth inscribed \"Boston Stone 1737\". There is no plaque and no further elucidation, and the Boston Stone has no official status."}}
