{"Cicero": {"Moses Montefiore Academy": "Sir Moses Haim Montefiore, 1st Baronet, FRS (24 October 1784 \u2013 28 July 1885) was a British financier and banker, activist, philanthropist and Sheriff of London. Born to an Italian Jewish family, he donated large sums of money to promote industry, business, economic development, education and health among the Jewish community in the Levant, including the founding of Mishkenot Sha'ananim in 1860, the first settlement of the New Yishuv. As President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, his correspondence with the British consul in Damascus Charles Henry Churchill in 1841\u201342 is seen as pivotal to the development of Proto-Zionism."}}
