{"Milwaukee": {"Marquette Gymnasium": "Marquette Gymnasium is a gymnasium on the campus of Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The building was the first full-time home of the Marquette men's basketball team before they moved, originally part-time, to the Milwaukee Arena. In later years, the building served as a practice facility for the team, as well as the home of the women's basketball and volleyball teams before the completion of the Al McGuire Center."}}
