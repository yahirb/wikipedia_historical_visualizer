{"Waltham": {"F. Lincoln Pierce Houses": "The F. Lincoln Pierce Houses are a pair of historic houses at 231 and 237 Mill Street in Newton, Massachusetts. Both houses were built in 1914 to designs by the Boston firm of Derby & Robinson. The house at 237 Mill Street is a well-executed example of neo-Federalist design, while the smaller house at 231 Mill Street is a more modest Georgian Revival cottage."}}
