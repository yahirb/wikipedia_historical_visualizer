{"Chapel_Hill": {"Tin Can (basketball arena)": "Officially named the Indoor Athletic Center (or Court), the Tin Can was the home of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball from the 1924 season until the team's relocation to the Woollen Gymnasium in 1938. It replaced Bynum Gymnasium, a venue known for its unusual running track suspended above the court.\nRudimentarily built of steel, attempts to heat the building during early season at first failed, with ice often forming inside:\nThe team, known as the White Phantoms, used this to their advantage, becoming one of the South's most successful programs by the mid-1920s."}}
