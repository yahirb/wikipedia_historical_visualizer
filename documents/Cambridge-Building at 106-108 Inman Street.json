{"Cambridge": {"Building at 106-108 Inman Street": "The Building at 106-108 Inman Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts is one of a series of well-preserved Greek Revival duplexes on Inman Street. This house was built in 1845, and features very straightforward Greek Revival styling, most notably in the pilasters that run the full two story height of the building, separating each of the front facade's bays. The building has a later Italianate porch sheltering the centered entrances."}}
