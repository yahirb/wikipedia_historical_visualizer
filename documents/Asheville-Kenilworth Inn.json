{"Asheville": {"Kenilworth Inn": "Kenilworth Inn is a large Tudor Revival building located in Asheville, North Carolina. Originally designed to replace an earlier hotel, it became a military hospital as soon as it was built. As it changed hands, it was used as a mental hospital, hotel, and other purposes until 2000, when it became an apartment building."}}
