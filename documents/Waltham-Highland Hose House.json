{"Waltham": {"Highland Hose House": "The Highland Hose House is a historic fire station at 1007 Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington, Massachusetts. The two story brick building was built in 1928 to a design by George Ernest Robinson. His Georgian Revival design emulates features found in Boston townhouses of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and its cupola and grasshopper weathervane resemble that of Faneuil Hall."}}
