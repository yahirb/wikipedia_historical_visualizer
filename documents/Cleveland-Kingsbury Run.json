{"Cleveland": {"Kingsbury Run": "Kingsbury Run is the name that refers to an area on the southeast side of Cleveland, Ohio, located near the suburb of Shaker Heights. The area stretches westward through Kinsman Road. It contained a natural watershed that ran through East 79th Street and carried storm waters into the Cuyahoga River, draining them from the areas now known as Maple Heights and Warrensville Heights."}}
