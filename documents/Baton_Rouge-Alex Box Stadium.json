{"Baton_Rouge": {"Alex Box Stadium": "Alex Box Stadium, sometimes pronounced as \"Elec\" or \"Alec\" Box was a baseball stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. It was the home field of the LSU Tigers baseball team. The stadium was located across the street from Tiger Stadium, which is visible in right field. It was most notable for The Intimidator, a large billboard behind the right-field fence featuring the five years in which LSU won the College World Series.\nThe stadium opened in 1938 and closed in 2008. It was replaced with a new stadium 200 yards to the south named Alex Box Stadium/Skip Bertman Field. Both structures were named for Simeon Alex Box, an LSU letterman (1942) who was killed in North Africa during World War II. The stadium was called LSU Diamond or LSU Varsity Baseball Field when it first opened.\nThe New York Giants held spring training at the ballpark in 1938 and 1939. The Giants played the first baseball game at the park, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5. The first LSU game was March 21, 1938. LSU led Minnesota, 4-2, after three innings when the game was halted due to rain. The first official LSU Game at the stadium was March 24, 1938 when Minnesota defeated LSU, 6-5.\nThe final regular season series at Alex Box Stadium was played between LSU and Mississippi State University.\nAt the time, it appeared this would be the last series ever at Alex Box Stadium; however, LSU was selected to host a regional in the NCAA Tournament (which it won), and subsequently hosted a Super Regional as the #7 national seed.\nIt appeared that Alex Box stadium would close on a sour note for the Tigers, as LSU dropped Game 1 to UC Irvine 11-5, and in Game 2, LSU was three outs away from elimination, trailing 7-4 in the ninth inning. However, UC Irvine was unable to close out the LSU Tigers and LSU came from behind to win the game 9-7.\nThe stadium was thus given one final chance to close on a high note, which it did in Game 3 of the Super Regional played on June 9, 2008, as LSU defeated UC Irvine 21-7. As a result of the victory, LSU won the Baton Rouge Super Regional two games to one and advanced to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In the final play at the stadium, Tyler Hoechlin hit a grounder to pitcher Anthony Ranaudo, who threw to first baseman Buzzy Haydel for the final out.\nThe stadium has been dismantled and sold to fans."}}
