{"Abilene": {"Hotel Wooten": "The Hotel Wooten is located in downtown Abilene, Texas at 1102 North 3rd Street.\n\nThis graceful 16-story tower was built at the corner of North 3rd and Cypress Street in 1930 by local business man H.O. Wooten legendarily paid for in cash in the midst of the Great Depression. With its massive red neon sign atop its roof, the hotel was visible miles on the flat Texas plains, particularly at night."}}
