{"Raleigh": {"Cloud Chamber for the Trees and Sky": "Cloud Chamber for the Trees and Sky is an outdoor exhibit by Chris Drury located in the museum park of the North Carolina Museum of Art.\nThe chamber itself is a round building built of stone, wood, and turf with a single door to admit the viewer. It is light-tight when its door is closed, except for one small, round opening in its roof which allows the building to act as a camera obscura."}}
