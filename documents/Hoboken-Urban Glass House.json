{"Hoboken": {"Urban Glass House": "Urban Glass House is a condominium building designed by American architect Philip Johnson located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. It was Johnson's final project; he did not live to see construction finished. The building's name is a reference to Johnson's earlier Glass House, located in New Canaan, Connecticut, although the Urban building bears little resemblance to the original."}}
