{"Buffalo": {"Blue Sky Mausoleum": "Blue Sky Mausoleum, in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York, is the recent completion of a 1928 design by Frank Lloyd Wright  as a commercial cemetery project. The design was completed by a one-time apprentice to Wright, Anthony Puttnam.\nPuttnam was also responsible for the posthumous completion of Wright's Monona Terrace building in Madison, Wisconsin in modified form, and he has defended both projects against accusations that they are inauthentic."}}
