{"Bellevue": {"Beacon Food Forest": "Beacon Food Forest is a 7-acre food forest in development adjacent to Jefferson Park on Beacon Hill in Seattle, Washington in the vicinity of 15th Ave South and South Dakota. By the design of the project, and as the area is on public land, food in the edible forest section of the project will be available freely to those visiting the park. The project also has more traditional private allotments, similar to those in other local P-Patch gardens."}}
