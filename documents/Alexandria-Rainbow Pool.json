{"Alexandria": {"Rainbow Pool": "The Rainbow Pool was a reflecting pool located on the National Mall in Washington D.C., USA. It was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and was situated between the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool (to the west), and 17th Street NW (to the east). The pool was renamed the Rainbow Pool on October 15, 1924 after it was noticed that its 124 nozzles created a \"perfect rainbow\" when turned on.\nIn 2001 it was integrated into the National World War II Memorial, which features the pool located in roughly the same spot."}}
