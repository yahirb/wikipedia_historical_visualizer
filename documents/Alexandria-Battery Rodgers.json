{"Alexandria": {"Battery Rodgers": "Battery Rodgers was a gun emplacement that composed a portion of the American Civil War defenses of the American capital city of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nBuilt in 1863, Battery Rodgers was constructed with the ability to interdict sea traffic sailing up the Potomac River to Washington. From its position on a 28-foot high cliff overlooking Battery Cove, it was positioned with a clear view of fire and was ably suited to guarding the southern Potomac River and Accotink Road (Fort Hunt Rd.) approaches to Washington. The battery was named for George W. Rodgers, a captain in the Union Navy who was killed during an attack on Fort Wagner."}}
