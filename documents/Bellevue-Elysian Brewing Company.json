{"Bellevue": {"Elysian Brewing Company": "The Elysian Brewing Company is an American brewery that operates four pubs in Seattle. On January 23, 2015, it was announced that Elysian would be sold to Anheuser-Busch in a deal expected to close within three months. This deal means that Elysian Brewing Company will no longer meet the Brewers Association definition of a \"craft brewery\", since full ownership by Anheuser-Busch exceeds the definition's 25% maximum ownership by a non-craft brewery \n\n\n== History ==\n\nElysian was founded in 1995 by Dave Buhler, Joe Bisacca, and Dick Cantwell."}}
