{"Portsmouth": {"Lambert Point Light": "The Lambert Point Light was a small screwpile lighthouse in Norfolk, Virginia; it was built in 1872.\nThe lighthouse was meant to serve the increased shipping traffic on the Elizabeth River, and initially was designed with six piles. The plans were changed when five surplus piles were found; in the end the structure was square, and sat on these five piles."}}
