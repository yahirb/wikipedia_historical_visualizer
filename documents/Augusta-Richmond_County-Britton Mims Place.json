{"Augusta-Richmond_County": {"Britton Mims Place": "The Britton Mims Place, located in North Augusta, South Carolina, exemplifies the Greek Revival style typical of secondary country residences during the antebellum period. Built around 1830, it is historically significant due to a number of architectural features, including its gabled roof, full width front verandah with hipped roof, and a number of outbuildings, including a (former) kitchen, wooden dog house, and a rectangular fowl house. This well-secluded home is not visible from the public highway."}}
