{"Miami": {"The Loft 2": "A bunk bed loft can be an upper storey or attic in a building, directly under the roof (US usage) or just a storage space under the roof usually accessed by a ladder (British usage). A loft apartment refers to large adaptable open space, often converted for residential use (a converted loft) from some other use, often light industrial. Adding to the confusion, some converted lofts include upper open loft areas."}}
