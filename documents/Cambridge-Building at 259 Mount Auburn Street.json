{"Cambridge": {"Building at 259 Mount Auburn Street": "259 Mount Auburn Street is a small historic house built in the Italianate style of architecture located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nDetails surrounding the construction of the house are unclear, because it was apparently moved to the site where it currently resides in the late 1850s. Its Italianate styling places its construction right around 1850, and its small size (22' by 18') suggests that it might have originally been built as a railroad depot, probably from the Watertown Branch Railroad."}}
