Upon its opening in 1951, the Terrace received critical acclaim for its \u201cbold architectural lines [and] extensive patron services.\u201d The 1,300-seat theater, designed in the mid-century modern style by the Minneapolis architectural firm of Liebenberg & Kaplan (L&K) for movie exhibitors Sidney and William Volk, was a popular Twin Cities destination for nearly fifty years. It changed hands in 1980 and again in 1987, when it was remodeled from a single-screen auditorium into three screens by dividing the balcony."}}
