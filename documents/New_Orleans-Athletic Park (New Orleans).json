{"New_Orleans": {"Athletic Park (New Orleans)": "Athletic Park was a sports stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana which opened in 1901. The ballpark was located on the south side of Tulane Avenue between South Carrollton Avenue and South Pierce Street. When the Pelicans moved a few blocks up the street to Pelican Park, this site was replaced by an amusement park called White City."}}
