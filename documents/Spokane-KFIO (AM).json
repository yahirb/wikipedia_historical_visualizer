{"Spokane": {"KFIO (AM)": "KFIO (1050 kHz) is an AM radio station licensed to Dishman, Washington and serves the Spokane media market. The station is owned by Thomas W. Read, through licensee Liberty Broadcasting System, LLC.\nThe station broadcasts in the daytime at 25,000 watts but at night it must reduce power to 260 watts; that is because 1050 kHz is assigned as a clear channel frequency reserved for Mexico, so it cannot use a higher power that might interfere with Mexican radio stations.\n\n\n== History ==\nKFIO first signed on as KEYF in 1984."}}
