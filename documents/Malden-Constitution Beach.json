{"Malden": {"Constitution Beach": "Constitution Beach is a man-made crescent-shaped, sandy beach located in the Orient Heights section of East Boston, a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Opened in 1952 and known to locals as \"Shays Beach,\" its most distinctive feature is that looks directly onto the runways of Logan International Airport, so that airplanes taking off and landing on Runways 22L and 22R are about 2,000 feet (610 m) away, making them prominent both visibly and audibly.\nThe beach is located on 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land, which was artificially constructed between December 1949 and May 1951."}}
