{"Vancouver": {"Swan Island Municipal Airport": "The Swan Island Municipal Airport was a joint civil-military airport that was operational in the Overlook neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It opened officially in 1927, but the United States Postal Service had been using the field for a year. After the Portland\u2013Columbia Super Airport was completed in the late 1930s, Swan Island Municipal Airport had little use since its runways were too small for newer aircraft and the low altitude made it difficult to land and take-off."}}
