{"Great_Falls": {"Cascade County Courthouse": "The Cascade County Courthouse in Great Falls, Montana is a historic courthouse built in 1901-1903. Founded in 1887, Cascade County conducted its business from several office buildings in town until the courthouse was built. The full city block site was purchased in 1891 at a cost of $20,000, but there was not enough tax revenue for the county to build a courthouse until a decade later."}}
