{"Minneapolis": {"NUCCA": "NUCCA is an acronym for the National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association. It was founded in 1966 by chiropractor Ralph Gregory and based primarily upon the work he and John Grostic had performed before Grostic's death in 1964. The new style of upper cervical adjusting technique was taught in 1966 at the first NUCCA seminar, which was held at the Howard Johnson Motel in Monroe, Michigan."}}
