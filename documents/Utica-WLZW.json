The station abruptly changed format in 1985 to classic hits as \"Z 98.7\" with the call letters WNYZ. After a while in the format, WNYZ next flipped to a rock-leaning Top 40 format, identifying as \"New York's Z-98.7\". The format began with Twisted Sister's We're Not Gonna Take It, followed by Quiet Riot's Cum On Feel the Noize."}}
