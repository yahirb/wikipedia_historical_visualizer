{"Walnut_Creek": {"Louis Guisto Field": "Louis Guisto Field is a baseball venue in Moraga, California, USA. It is home to the Saint Mary's Gaels baseball team of the NCAA Division I West Coast Conference. Opened in 2012, the venue replaced the old Louis Guisto Field (the location of which was behind the third base line of the new facility) as the home of Saint Mary's baseball. Like the old facility, it is named for former Saint Mary's baseball player and coach Louis Guisto."}}
