{"South_San_Francisco": {"Harbor Village Resort": "The Harbor Village Resort was a proposed complex of three skyscrapers intended for San Francisco's India Basin in the Bayview-Hunters Point district. To be located on Hudson Street, the mixed-use complex would have consisted of a 250-boat marina and three 61 story skyscrapers towering 650 feet (198 m) over the marina. The three towers, to be named Harbor Village Resort I, II & III, would be spaced 300 ft (91 m) apart."}}
