{"Houston": {"The Crab": "Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting \"tail\" (abdomen) (Greek: \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2, translit. brachys = short, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03ac / \u03bfura = tail), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws."}}
