The station is located at 2121 West Northwest Highway (US 14) and Wilke Road, within Arlington Park Race Course, and lies 24.4 miles (39.3 km) from the Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago. In Metra's zone-based fare system, Arlington Park is in zone E.\nThe Arlington Park station was designed originally to serve just the Arlington Park Race Track, but now serves postal employees at the Processing and Distribution Center in Palatine as well as residents of southeast Palatine and west Arlington Heights, although a fence blocks most of the access to the station from the Palatine side."}}
