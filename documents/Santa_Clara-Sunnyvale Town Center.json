{"Santa_Clara": {"Sunnyvale Town Center": "Sunnyvale Town Center was a two-level shopping mall located in Sunnyvale, California, USA. It opened in 1979 on the site of much of the city's downtown, and was anchored by Macy's, Montgomery Wards, and later, J.C. Penney. Target moved in when Montgomery Wards closed. By the early 2000s, the mall had failed financially and only the Target and Macy's stores remained open."}}
