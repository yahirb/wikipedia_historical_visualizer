{"Hoboken": {"Empire Diner": "The Empire Diner is a restaurant in New York City that launched a vogue for upscale retro diners, and whose Art Moderne exterior became an iconic image in numerous films and television programs.\nConstructed by the Fodero Dining Car Company in 1946 and operating as a Manhattan diner until being abandoned years later, it was refurbished in 1976, with additions including a stylized Empire State Building outline on its roof. It became a city fixture and an artists' nexus from then on."}}
