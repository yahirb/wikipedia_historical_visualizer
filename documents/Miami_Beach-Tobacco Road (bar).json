{"Miami_Beach": {"Tobacco Road (bar)": "The Tobacco Road was a bar in the Brickell area of Downtown Miami, Florida, United States. It was popularly known as the oldest bar in the city. The liquor license it amended was first issued in November 1912 (though property records show the building as being built in 1915, as a bakery) and operated nearly continuously since its opening, having been shut down briefly at times for run-ins with the law, such as when the upstairs, now a live music venue, was used as a speakeasy during Prohibition."}}
