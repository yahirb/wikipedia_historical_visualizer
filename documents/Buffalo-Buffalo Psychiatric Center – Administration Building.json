{"Buffalo": {"Buffalo Psychiatric Center \u2013 Administration Building": "The Former Administration Building of the Buffalo Psychiatric Center is the central building of the Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, New York.\nThe administration building has monumental, medieval, double, identical towers (each 185 feet tall), each with four corner turrets and dramatically steep copper roofs punctuated with dormered windows, all of which gave the administration building an imposing appearance. These great paired towers make the Richardson Olmsted Complex one of the most striking public buildings in America."}}
