{"Trenton": {"E. R. Johnstone Training and Research Center": "The E.R. Johnstone Training and Research Center was a mental institution in Bordentown, Burlington County, New Jersey, United States, that housed people with developmental disability. Located adjacent to the Juvenile Medium Security Center in Bordentown, and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Edward R. Johnstone Training and Research Center opened in 1955 after the state closed the New Jersey Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth as a result of the 1954 decision in the US Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education."}}
