{"Quincy": {"Wollaston Fire Station": "Wollaston Fire Station is a historic fire station at 111 Beale Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The two-story brick building was built in 1900 on the site of an earlier wooden fire station, and is a fine local example of Italianate design. The tower, which dominates the structure, has a low-pitch tile roof over a corbelled eave, and an arched arcade."}}
