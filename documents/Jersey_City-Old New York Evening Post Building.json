{"Jersey_City": {"Old New York Evening Post Building": "The Old New York Evening Post Building is the former office and printing plant of the New York Evening Post newspaper located at 20 Vesey Street between Church Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It was built in 1906-07 and was designed by architect Robert D. Kohn for Oswald Garrison Villard, who owned the Post at the time, and is considered to be \"one of the few outstanding Art nouveau buildings\" ever constructed in the United States.\nThe fourteen-story, stone-veneer building is \"reminiscent of the buildings that line the boulevards of Paris\", and was not copied from an existing building."}}
