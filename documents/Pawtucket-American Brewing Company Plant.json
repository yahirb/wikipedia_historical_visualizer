{"Pawtucket": {"American Brewing Company Plant": "The American Brewing Company Plant is a historic beer brewery complex at 431 Harris Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island, developed between 1892 and 1922. It is a well-preserved example of a state of the art late 19th century brewery building, its original functions still discernible in its layout. It was only used as a brewery until 1922, when it was shut down by Prohibition; it has served as a warehouse and storage facility for most of the time since."}}
