{"Stamford": {"Linden Apartments": "The Linden Apartments are a historic multiunit apartment house at 10-12 Linden Pl. in Stamford, Connecticut. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame Second Empire style building with a mansard roof, and projecting window bays. Built in 1886, it is the most architecturally distinctive tenement house in the city, and is its oldest surviving six-unit building. It was probably built by George Hoyt, one Stamford's leading 19th-century real estate developers.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983."}}
