{"Burnsville": {"Dan Patch": "Dan Patch (April 29, 1896 \u2013 July 11, 1916) was a noted American Standardbred pacer. At a time when harness racing was one of the largest sports in the nation, Dan Patch was a major celebrity. He was undefeated in open competition and was so dominant on the racetrack that other owners eventually refused to enter their horses against him."}}
