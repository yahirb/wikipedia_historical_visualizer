{"Pocatello": {"Alameda, Idaho": "Alameda was a city in Bannock County, Idaho, United States. Alameda was established as a village in 1924 at the consolidation of the villages of Fairview and North Pocatello which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in 1911 and 1914 respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later designated U.S. Route 91), one of Idaho's first designated highways."}}
