{"Pittsburgh": {"Burke Building": "The Burke Building in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is a building from 1836. It was Pittsburgh's first major office building and a major anchor of the city's financial district centered on Fourth Avenue. Since the 1845 Great Fire burned over a thousand buildings, it is the city's only remaining large Greek Revival building."}}
