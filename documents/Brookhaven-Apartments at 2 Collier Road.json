{"Brookhaven": {"Apartments at 2 Collier Road": "The Apartments at 2 Collier Road were built by developer Henry M. Rice in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. The apartments were built on lands formerly belonging to George Washington Collier. The Colonial Revival style buildings are of the \"big house\" style, giving the impression of a single large residence rather than an apartment building."}}
