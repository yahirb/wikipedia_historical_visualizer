{"Kirkland": {"Downtown Redmond station": "Downtown Redmond station is a proposed Link Light Rail station on the north side of Redmond Town Center shopping mall in downtown Redmond, Washington.\nThe proposed location of the station is at Cleveland Street (SR 202) between 164th Ave NE and 166th Ave NE. However, this station may be moved northeast to a new location more towards central Downtown Redmond because it will not have a stop, as previously considered, at Redmond Transit Center.\nThe station was originally included in the Sound Transit 2 ballot measure in 2008, but was left out of the East Link Extension after a funding shortfall stemming from the City of Bellevue's desire for a tunneled alignment under Downtown Bellevue."}}
