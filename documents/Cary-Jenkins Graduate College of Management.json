{"Cary": {"Jenkins Graduate College of Management": "On September 21, 2007, the graduate programs in North Carolina State University's College of Management were brought under one name - the Jenkins Graduate School of Management. The programs were named in honor of Benjamin (Ben) P. Jenkins, III, a 1968 graduate of the university and vice-chairman and president of the General Bank at Wachovia Corporation.\nThe Jenkins Graduate School includes the Master of Accounting and Master of Business Administration programs in the NC State College of Management, and the Graduate Economics Program offered jointly by NC State's colleges of agriculture and life sciences and management.\nThe naming gift will be used to endow professorships and provide graduate scholarships for students. In addition, the naming of the graduate school will result in better name recognition for NC State's programs with students while competing with Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan-Flagler Business School."}}
