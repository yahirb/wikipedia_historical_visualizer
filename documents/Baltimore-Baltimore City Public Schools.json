{"Baltimore": {"Baltimore City Public Schools": "Baltimore City Public Schools, also referred to as Baltimore City Public School System, BCPSS, BCPS and City Schools, is a public school district in the state of Maryland, United States. It serves the youth for the city of Baltimore (in distinction to the separate and \"younger\" public school system (district) for the surrounding county of Baltimore, known as the Baltimore County Public Schools [BCoPS]). Traditionally however, the Baltimore City Public Schools system has usually never referred to itself as a \"district,\" as the operation of the schools was synonymous with the city of Baltimore."}}
