{"Lakewood": {"Fort Steilacoom": "For the adjacent park, see Fort Steilacoom Park\nFort Steilacoom was founded by the U.S. Army in 1849 near Lake Steilacoom. It was among the first military fortifications built by the U.S. north of the Columbia River in what was to become Washington. The fort was constructed due to civilian agitation about the massacre in 1847 at the Whitman mission."}}
