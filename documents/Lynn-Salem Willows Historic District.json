{"Lynn": {"Salem Willows Historic District": "The Salem Willows Historic District of eastern Salem, Massachusetts encompasses a now residential area that had its origins as a 19th-century summer resort community. Development of the area began in 1875, after Daniel Gardner purchased land at Juniper Point he had been leasing with the intent of developing it. There is evidence from an 1874 map that he may have begun development as early as 1874, even though he did not have permission to erect permanent structures on the land then."}}
