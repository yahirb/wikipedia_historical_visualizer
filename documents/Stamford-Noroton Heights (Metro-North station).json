{"Stamford": {"Noroton Heights (Metro-North station)": "The Noroton Heights station serves the residents of Darien, Connecticut via the New Haven Line. It is 36.2 miles from Grand Central Terminal.\nThe station is located near Exit 10 on Interstate 95. The highway borders the southern side of the station, which faces Heights Road to the north, Hollow Tree Ridge Road to the west and has access to Noroton Avenue to the east (via Ledge Road). The station is one of two in Darien; the other is the Darien Metro-North train station.\nThe Noroton Heights station building is \"unique in that it resembles an overgrown Plexiglass [sic] shelter protected by a metal lean-to,\" according to a January 2007 state Department of Transportation report. According to the report, the station is a \"notable alternative to the downtown Stamford train station. The Noroton Heights station is not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. All the railroad parking at the station (772 spaces) is owned by the state. The farthest available parking spaces are as much as 1,500 feet from the station."}}
