{"Minneapolis": {"Architects and Engineers Building": "The Architects and Engineers Building is an office building in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, designed by locally notable architects Hewitt and Brown and built by builders Pike and Cook. The building was influenced by Hewitt and Brown's relationship with designers who were dedicated to the City Beautiful movement. They intended to save money by grouping their practices in one building, and they also desired \"the special advantage of proximity and the facility for making the knowledge and experience of each available to others.\" The building was designed with private executive offices, as well as common drafting rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, and clerical facilities."}}
