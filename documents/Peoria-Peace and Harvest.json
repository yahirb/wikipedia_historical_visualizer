{"Peoria": {"Peace and Harvest": "Peace and Harvest are two 8-foot (2.4 m) tall limestone statues in downtown Peoria, Illinois, United States. The male and female figures represent peace and harvest respectively. The statues were sculpted by Chicagoan Mary Andersen Clark (born in 1910 and formerly of Peoria) as part of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988."}}
