{"Portland": {"Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal": "The Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal is a cruise ship terminal in Portland, Maine, USA. It was built in two phases; phase 1 being a new terminal building that in 2008 replaced the original International Marine Terminal and phase 2 being a new berth and docking facility for large cruise ships known as Ocean Gateway Pier II.\nPlans for the new passenger terminal were made as early as 2003, when the Portland city council presented an early design for the facility, including two buildings \u2014 a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) receiving building and a 16,000 square foot terminal building \u2014 built at the end of a pier. Construction began in September 2005, after the Reed and Reed construction company won the contract in June.\nThe main terminal building is built over the water, and is a two-story structure, with customs facilities for international passengers on the first floor and a waiting area on the second."}}
