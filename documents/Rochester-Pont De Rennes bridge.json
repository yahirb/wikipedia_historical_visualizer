{"Rochester": {"Pont De Rennes bridge": "The Pont De Rennes bridge is located in the Brown's Race Historic District of Rochester New York at the base of the High Falls where it spans the Genesee River. The Pont De Rennes bridge formerly carried Platt Street  over the river but was converted to pedestrian use in 1982 as part of a redevelopment of the High Falls area as an entertainment area. The bridge was renamed the Pont De Rennes for Rochester's sister city Rennes in France as part of the conversion."}}
