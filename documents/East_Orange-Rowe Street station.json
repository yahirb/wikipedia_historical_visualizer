{"East_Orange": {"Rowe Street station": "Rowe Street is an abandoned train station in the town of Bloomfield, New Jersey. The station was a former stop on the Boonton Line, which ran from Hoboken Terminal to Hackettstown, reaching Rowe Street in Bloomfield. The station was constructed by the Erie Railroad in 1955 as a replacement for the Orchard Street station and the former Bloomfield station (at Walnut Street), which was eliminated for construction of the Garden State Parkway."}}
