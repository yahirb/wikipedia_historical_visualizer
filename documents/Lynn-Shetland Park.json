The Park accommodates a variety of uses including office space, flex space, R&D, warehouse and storage.\nOriginally on the site was the first steam-powered textile mill in the country, built by the Naumkeag Steam Cotton Company in 1839. As the sheeting it made was produced under the brand name of Pequot, it became known locally as the Pequot Mills."}}
