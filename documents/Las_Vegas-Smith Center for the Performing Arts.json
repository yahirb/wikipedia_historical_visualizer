{"Las_Vegas": {"Smith Center for the Performing Arts": "The Smith Center for the Performing Arts is located in Downtown Las Vegas's 61-acre Symphony Park and is a five-acre performing arts center consisting of three theaters in two buildings; groundbreaking for the $470 million project was May 26, 2009. The Neo Art Deco design style was chosen by David M. Schwarz to echo the design elements of the Hoover Dam, just 30 miles to the southeast. It also shares design features with the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas."}}
