{"Las_Vegas": {"K\u00e0": "K\u00e0 is a show by Cirque du Soleil at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. K\u00e0 describes the story as \"the coming of age of a young man and a young woman through their encounters with love, conflict and the duality of K\u00e0, the fire that can unite or separate, destroy or illuminate.\"\nIn its review, the Los Angeles Times stated it \"may well be the most lavish production in the history of Western theater. It is surely the most technologically advanced.\" The New York Times highly praised all the technical aspects and costumes, but felt that it did not succeed in a particularly compelling story, rather it was \"essentially about the kind of wild physical feats that all Cirque shows are about, their jaw-dropping effect multiplied by the huge dimensions of the theatrical space.\" The show has been seen by more than one million spectators since its opening in February 2005."}}
