{"Lynn": {"House at 52 Oak Street": "The House at 52 Oak Street in Wakefield, Massachusetts is one of the most elaborate Colonial Revival houses in the Greenwood section of town. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in the 1890s. It has significant Queen Anne styling, including a turret and wraparound porch, but porch details such as the multiple columns on paneled piers are Colonial Revival in style, as are the hip-roof dormers."}}
