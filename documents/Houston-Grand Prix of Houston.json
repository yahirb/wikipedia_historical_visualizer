{"Houston": {"Grand Prix of Houston": "The Shell and Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston was an annual auto race on the IndyCar Series circuit. It was held in a street circuit located in downtown Houston for four years, then returned after a four-year hiatus for two years on a course laid out in the parking lot of the Reliant/NRG Park complex. Before resuming in 2013, the last race was held on April 22, 2007 (with the IRL merger canceling the 2008 event just two months prior to the event)."}}
