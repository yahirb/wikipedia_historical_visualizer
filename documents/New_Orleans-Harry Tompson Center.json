{"New_Orleans": {"Harry Tompson Center": "Harry Tompson Center (HTC) has its roots in a Jesuit's outreach to the homeless while he was pastor of Immaculate Conception parish on Baronne Street in New Orleans. When Fr. Harry Tompson, S.J., died in 2001 his friends and supporters carried on his efforts at providing a full array of services for the homeless, to which they added his name."}}
