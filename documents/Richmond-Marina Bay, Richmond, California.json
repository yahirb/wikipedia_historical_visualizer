{"Richmond": {"Marina Bay, Richmond, California": "Marina Bay, sometimes referred to as the \"Richmond Riviera\", is located in Richmond's protected Inner Harbor. It was developed in the mid-1980s in an effort to clean up what had been up to that point the defunct World War II-era Kaiser Shipyards. Marina Bay was planned as an up-scale residential waterfront community with apartments, condominiums, townhouses, and houses."}}
