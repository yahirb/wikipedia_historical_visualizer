{"San_Mateo": {"Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia": "The Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia, located in Burlingame, California, opened in 1995 and is run by Gary Doss, who had been collecting Pez dispensers for more than a decade. The museum claims to have an example of every Pez dispenser ever sold. Doss initially ran a computer store and displayed some of their dispensers in the store, when they discovered that customers were more interested in the dispensers than in the computers."}}
