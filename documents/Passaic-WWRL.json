Broadcasting from a transmitter site in Secaucus, New Jersey, WWRL airs an Indian and South Asian radio format and is owned by Nimisha and Jeetendra Shukla through licensee NJ Broadcasting, LLC.\nFounded in 1926, WWRL originally had a multi-lingual format serving the various ethnic communities of New York City. The station took on a mostly Spanish identity in the 1950s, then became primarily oriented towards the African American community of New York City in the mid-1960s, under the direction of News Director, Dick London, who invited community leaders to voice their concerns publicly on air, as the station became advocates for legislative change."}}
