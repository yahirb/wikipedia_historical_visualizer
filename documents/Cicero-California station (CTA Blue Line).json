{"Cicero": {"California station (CTA Blue Line)": "California is a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system, serving the Blue Line, on North California Avenue near West Fullerton Avenue in the Logan Square neighborhood. From California, trains run every 2\u20137 minutes during rush-hour periods, and take 12 minutes to reach the Loop. It is not to be confused with the California Station on the Blue Line's Congress Branch, which permanently shuttered its doors in 1973."}}
