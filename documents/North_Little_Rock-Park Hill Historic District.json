{"North_Little_Rock": {"Park Hill Historic District": "The Park Hill Historic District encompasses the first suburban residential subdivision of the city of North Little Rock, Arkansas. It covers 172 acres (70 ha) in a geographically central part of the city, bisected by JFK Boulevard, and roughly bounded on the north by H Avenue, the west by Ridge Road, the east by Cedar Street and Plainview Circle, and the south by Crestview Drive. This area was developed beginning in 1922 by Justin Matthews, a major local developer, and greatly expanded the city's housing stock through the 1940s and 1950s."}}
