{"Fall_River": {"Borden\u2013Winslow House": "The Borden\u2013Winslow House is a historic house located at 3063 North Main Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. It was built circa 1740 in the Steep Brook area, then still part of Freetown, making it possibly the oldest extant house in Fall River. Of particular interest is the fine Georgian pediment doorway, which includes a six-light transom within its entablature."}}
