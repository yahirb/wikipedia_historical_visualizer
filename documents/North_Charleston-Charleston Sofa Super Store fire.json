{"North_Charleston": {"Charleston Sofa Super Store fire": "The Charleston Sofa Super Store fire occurred on the evening of June 18, 2007, in Charleston, South Carolina and killed nine firefighters. This was the deadliest firefighter disaster in the US since the September 11 attacks, until June 30, 2013, when 19 Prescott, Arizona, firefighters from the elite \"Granite Mountain Hotshots\" team died at the Yarnell Hill Wildfire. The fire was believed to have started in some discarded furniture in the loading dock area, and though the source of ignition has been left undetermined, there is reason to believe it may have been a discarded cigarette."}}
