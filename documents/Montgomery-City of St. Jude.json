{"Montgomery": {"City of St. Jude": "Jude, also known as Judas Thaddaeus (Coptic: \u2c91\u2c81\u2c87\u2c87\u2c89\u2c9f\u2ca5), was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. He is generally identified with Thaddeus, and is also variously called Jude of James, Jude Thaddaeus, Judas Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus. He is sometimes identified with Jude, the brother of Jesus, but is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Jesus prior to his crucifixion."}}
