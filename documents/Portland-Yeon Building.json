{"Portland": {"Yeon Building": "The Yeon Building is a historic 59.13 m (194.0 ft), 15-story office building completed in 1911 in downtown Portland, Oregon. Almost completely clad in glazed terra-cotta, and culminating in a colonnade on the top floors, the Yeon Building once was illuminated at night by light sockets built into the cornices, but later removed. The building's namesake is Jean Baptiste Yeon (1865\u20131928), a self-made timber tycoon who financed the construction."}}
