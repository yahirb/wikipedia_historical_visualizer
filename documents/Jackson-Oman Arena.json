{"Jackson": {"Oman Arena": "The Oman Arena (originally Jackson Coliseum) is a 5,600-seat multi-purpose arena, in Jackson, Tennessee, USA. It was opened in 1967, and is architecturally similar to the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, which was built four years earlier and seats almost twice as many patrons as Oman Arena.\nThe arena is located between the campuses of Madison Academic Magnet High School and the former Jackson Central-Merry High School, in central Jackson.\nIn the 1980s, it was renamed in honor of the late Tury Oman, a local long-time coach."}}
