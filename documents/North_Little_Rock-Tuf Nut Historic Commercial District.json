{"North_Little_Rock": {"Tuf Nut Historic Commercial District": "The Tuf Nut Historic Commercial District encompasses two commercial/industrial buildings at 300-312 South Rock Street and 423 East 3rd Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. These brick buildings were built in 1922 and 1927 for the Tuf Nut Garment Manufacturing Company, and are representative of the industrial development of eastern downtown Little Rock during the period between 1922 and 1950. Both buildings are essentially vernacular, representing a trend of that period toward utilitarian forms for industrial architecture."}}
