{"Pittsburgh": {"11 Stanwix Street": "11 Stanwix Street, formerly known as Westinghouse Tower, is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. The tower was originally built and named for the Westinghouse Corporation; in 1999 that company went through a restructuring and moved its headquarters to its longtime research park in the suburb of Monroeville, before expansions in their operations necessitated a move to a larger suburban complex in Cranberry Township. Tenants today include IBM, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the advertising firm Brunner and the local headquarters of KeyCorp.\n11 Stanwix Street was completed on November 24, 1969, and has 23 floors."}}
