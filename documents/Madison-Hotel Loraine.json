{"Madison": {"Hotel Loraine": "Hotel Loraine, also known as The Loraine, is a ten-story high-rise building located in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. Designed in the Beaux-arts style by architect Herbert W. Tullgren, the hotel was built for Milwaukee hotel and insurance magnate Walter Schroeder, and was Madison's leading hotel for many years. After the hotel went out of business in 1968 the building housed the state Departments of Justice and Commerce."}}
