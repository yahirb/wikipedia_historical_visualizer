{"Pittsburgh": {"Manchester, Point and Wabash bridge piers": "The Manchester, Point and Wabash bridge piers are former bridge piers from three different bridges at different locations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Manchester Bridge opened in 1915, and connected the North Shore to The Point of Pittsburgh. The bridge was demolished in 1970, and only the northern pier was left standing for a proposed observation deck that was never built."}}
