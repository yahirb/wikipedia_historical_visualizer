{"Killeen": {"Under the Hood Caf\u00e9": "Under the Hood Caf\u00e9 was a coffee house located at 17 South College Street in Killeen, Texas. It provided services for soldiers located at Fort Hood, one of the largest American military installation in the world. Under the Hood Caf\u00e9 was first managed by Cynthia Thomas,\n\n but later managers were Kyle Wesolowski, Lori Hurlebaus and Malachi Muncy. Under the Hood is a project of the Fort Hood Support Network. It bills itself as being a safe place for local soldiers to spend off-duty time at, where the normal issues of rank are irrelevant. It is also the host of the monthly Killeen Poetry Slam.\n\nThe coffeehouse closed its doors in 2015 but the Fort Hood Support Network still exists as a project that has received a construction permit from the FCC to operate a low-power FM radio station serving the Fort Hood-Killeen community."}}
