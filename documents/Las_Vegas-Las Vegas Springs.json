{"Las_Vegas": {"Las Vegas Springs": "The Las Vegas Springs or Big Springs is the site of a natural oasis, known traditionally as a cienega. For more than 15,000 years, springs broke through the desert floor, creating grassy meadows (called las vegas by Mexican explorers). The bubbling springs were a source of water for Native Americans living here at least 5,000 years ago."}}
