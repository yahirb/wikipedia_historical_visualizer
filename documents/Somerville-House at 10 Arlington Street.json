{"Somerville": {"House at 10 Arlington Street": "The House at 10 Arlington Street in Somerville, Massachusetts, also known as the Walter J. Squire House, is a well-preserved transitional Italianate/Queen Anne house. The basic 2.5 story, front gable, three bay side entrance layout was fairly typical for Italianate houses in the city, as are the paired cornice brackets and hoods over the windows. The porch, however, has Queen Anne elements, including turned posts and the rising sun motif on its gable."}}
