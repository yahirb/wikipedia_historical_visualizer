{"Huntington": {"Memphis Tennessee Garrison House": "The Memphis Tennessee Garrison House is a historic house at 1701 10th Avenue in Huntington, West Virginia. Built about 1920, this modest two-story frame house was the home of Memphis Tennessee Garrison (1890-1988), a leading figure in the advance of African-American civil rights in Huntington, for the last forty years of her life. Garrison was a teacher, political organizer, and influential leader of the local branch of the NAACP. She was the first female of the West Virginia State Teachers Association, and vice-president of the American Teachers Association, an association of teachers working in segregated schools."}}
