{"Montgomery": {"The Murphy House": "The Murphy House is a historic Greek Revival style house in Montgomery, Alabama. The two-story masonry building was built for John H. Murphy, a Virginia cotton and slavery merchant who owned a large warehouse at 122 Commerce Street, Montgomery, where slave traders in the 1850s confined slaves until they could be sold at auctions. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 1972."}}
