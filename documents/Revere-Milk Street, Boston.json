{"Revere": {"Milk Street, Boston": "Milk Street is a street in the financial district of Boston, Massachusetts. It was one of Boston's earliest highways. The name \"Milk Street\" was most likely given to the street in 1708 due to a milk market at the location, although Grace Croft's 1952 work \"History and Genealogy of Milk Family\" instead proposes that Milk Street may have been named for John Milk, an early shipwright in Boston."}}
