{"Fayetteville": {"Johnson Switch Building": "The Johnson Switch Building is a historic commercial building in 3201 Main Street in Johnson, Arkansas. Built in 1904, it is a single-story structure with a pressed-metal facade designed to resemble brickwork, and a gable roof obscured by a stepped parapet. Named for a nearby railroad switch, it is the oldest surviving commercial building in the small community's downtown area."}}
