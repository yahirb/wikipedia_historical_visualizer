{"Davis": {"University of California, Davis Fire Department": "The University of California, Davis Fire Department, commonly known as the UC Davis Fire Department (UCDFD), provides fire protection and emergency medical services to the UC Davis campus and surrounding Yolo County Communities under an automatic aid agreement. In addition to the standard risks faced by any department, the UCDFD also must handle various types of research facilities and laboratories which present unique hazards.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe need for a fire department on the UC Davis campus was first raised when it was still the Berkeley Farm by the Dean of the College of Agriculture in 1917 when several hand-drawn hose carts were purchased and placed in sheds throughout the farm."}}
