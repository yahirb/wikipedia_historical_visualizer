{"Houston": {"Houston Tower": "The Houston Tower was a visionary plan for a 500-story skyscraper conceived in the 1970s to be built in Houston, originally designed as a research project for the feasibility of a 500-story building. American Architect Robert B. Sobel of Emery Roth & Sons, with engineer and fellow American Nat W. Krahl of Rice University, created a concept for a 500-story building made from 200-foot sided bundled triangular tubes. Sobel had theorized the construction of a 500-story building as early as 1974."}}
