{"Reno": {"Immaculate Conception Church (Sparks, Nevada)": "The Immaculate Conception Church, located at 2900 McCarran Way in Sparks, Nevada, is a brick Roman Catholic church that was built in 1932 to replace an earlier church that was built in 1905 but destroyed by a fire in 1930. It was designed by prolific Nevada architect Frederic J. DeLongchamps (1882-1969) in Mediterranean Revival architecture.\nIt was used as a Catholic church as late as 2004 when construction on a larger building was completed and the parish moved to that location."}}
