{"New Britain": {"Downtown New Britain": "Downtown New Britain is the historic commercial and civic heart of the city of New Britain, Connecticut. It is located in the southern part of the city, anchored by the triangular Central Park and City Hall on the north, and by Franklin Park on the south. The city was one of Connecticut's industrial powerhouses of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which is reflected in the abundance, style, and quality of the architecture found in the downtown."}}
