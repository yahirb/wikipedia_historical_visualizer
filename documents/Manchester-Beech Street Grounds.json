{"Manchester": {"Beech Street Grounds": "The Beech Street Grounds were a baseball-only stadium in Manchester, New Hampshire between 1892 and 1895. Constructed at the corner of Beech and Valley Streets on land owned by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, the grounds were part of a section of the city known as the Plains, a relatively flat area on which children and organized amateur teams had played baseball since at least as early as 1880. The park was composed of a wooden fence and two covered wooden grandstands, and its main (third-base-side) entrance was located on Beech Street."}}
