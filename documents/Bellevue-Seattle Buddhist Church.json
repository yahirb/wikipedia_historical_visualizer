{"Bellevue": {"Seattle Buddhist Church": "Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Temple (built 1940\u201341) is a Japanese Jodo Shinshu Buddhist temple in Seattle, Washington, USA, and a member of the Buddhist Churches of America.\nAlthough it was designed by Japanese American Kichio Allen Arai, the architect of record was Pierce A. Horrocks, because Arai lacked an architectural license. It replaced an earlier Seattle Buddhist Church (1906\u20131908, Charles W. Saunders & George Willis Lawton) that was torn down as part of the Yesler Terrace project."}}
