{"Los_Angeles": {"Higgins Building": "The Higgins Building is a proto-Modernist concrete framed building rendered in the Beaux-Arts style located in downtown Los Angeles, California. Completed in 1910 by owner Thomas Higgins, an Irish American, the 10-story building was originally used for office space. The Engineers and Architects were Albert C. Martin, Sr. and A.L. Haley. It has been designated as a historical monument by the City as Historic-Cultural Monument #873. Although designed as an 8 story high building, it was decided during the construction stage to add 2 additional floors in order to hold the reputation as being the highest building in the city centre."}}
