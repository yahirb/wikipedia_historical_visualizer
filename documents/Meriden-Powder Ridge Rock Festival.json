{"Meriden": {"Powder Ridge Rock Festival": "The Powder Ridge Rock Festival was scheduled to be held July 31, August 1 and August 2, 1970 at Powder Ridge Ski Area in Middlefield, Connecticut. A legal injunction forced the event to be canceled, keeping the musicians away; but a crowd of 30,000 attendees[1] arrived anyway, to find no food, no entertainment, no adequate plumbing, and at least seventy drug dealers. William Manchester wrote: \"Powder Ridge was an accident waiting to happen, and it happened.\"[2] Volunteer doctor William Abruzzi declared a drug \"crisis\" on 1 August and said \"Woodstock was a pale pot scene."}}
