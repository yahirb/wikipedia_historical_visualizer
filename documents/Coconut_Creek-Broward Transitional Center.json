{"Coconut_Creek": {"Broward Transitional Center": "The Broward Transitional Center (BTC) is a for-profit detention center located in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is owned and operated by the GEO Group under a twenty-million-dollar plus annual contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), purposed to hold alleged illegal immigrants classified as \"non-criminal and low security detainees.\"\nTwenty-six members of Congress, including Ted Deutsch, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson, signed a letter to ICE Director John T. Morton, urging a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d review of each individual detainee placed there, and an investigation of the cases detainees cited at Broward Transitional Center after allegations of lack of sufficient medical care for undocumented detainees. This included a detainee who underwent ovarian surgery and was locked back up in her cell the same day, still bleeding, and a man who urinated blood for days but was prevented from seeing a doctor."}}
