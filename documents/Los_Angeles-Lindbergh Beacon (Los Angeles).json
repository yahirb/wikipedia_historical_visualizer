{"Los_Angeles": {"Lindbergh Beacon (Los Angeles)": "The Lindbergh Beacon, an aircraft beacon atop the Los Angeles City Hall, operated nightly from April 26, 1928, until just after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was restored to its original condition in 2001, and Los Angeles magazine described it as \"a tiara of light atop our beautifully restored Los Angeles City Hall.\" City officials now occasionally put the beacon into operation for special occasions such as the year-end holidays."}}
