{"Fayetteville": {"Clack House": "The Clack House is a historic house at 725 East Dogwood Lane in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Prairie School house was designed by John G. Williams, then a professor of architecture at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and founder of its architecture department, and was built in 1954-56. The house was designed for the Clacks with energy efficiency in mind, using hollow cavity masonry walls, while providing expansive views of the city from many windows."}}
