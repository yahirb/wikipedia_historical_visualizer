Held six weeks following the United States Bicentennial, it was the second major at Congressional; the U.S. Open was conducted twelve years earlier in 1964.\nDave Stockton, the 1970 champion, sank a 15-foot (5 m) putt to save par on the 72nd hole to win his second PGA Championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Raymond Floyd and Don January. The final round was delayed to Monday for the first time, due to weather."}}
