{"Colorado_Springs": {"Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site": "Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site or the Chambers Ranch is a living history museum (sometimes called an open-air museum) and farm located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. Restored buildings and period-appropriate attired museum guides depict life in the Pikes Peak region in four time periods and in four different households: American Indian life in 1775; an 1860s cabin (Galloway Homestead); an 1880s farm (Chambers Home and Ranch); and a 1907 Edwardian Country Estate. Each residence (teepee, log cabin, farm house, mansion) reflects the construction and contents of homes of those periods."}}
