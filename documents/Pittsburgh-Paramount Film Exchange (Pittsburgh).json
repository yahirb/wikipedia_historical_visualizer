{"Pittsburgh": {"Paramount Film Exchange (Pittsburgh)": "Paramount Film Exchange is a building at 1727 Boulevard of the Allies in the Uptown or Bluff neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, designed in 1926 by R. E. Hall Co. architects from New York City. In 2010, the building was bought by arts-oriented local entrepreneurs who founded the Paramount Film Exchange (PFEX), Inc., to redevelop the then-abandoned building in a historically sensitive manner."}}
