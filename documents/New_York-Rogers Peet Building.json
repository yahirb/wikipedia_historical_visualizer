{"New_York": {"Rogers Peet Building": "Rogers Peet Building was a five-story structure which was built in Manhattan in 1863 in City Hall Park. It was home to the Rogers Peet clothing store until December 4, 1898. It belonged to the Emanuel Hoffman estate and was one of the historic buildings of New York City. The edifice, located at Broadway and Warren Street, burned entirely during a fire which accounted for more than $1,000,000 in property losses."}}
