{"Little_Rock": {"Main Street Commercial District (Little Rock, Arkansas)": "The Main Street Commercial District is a historic district encompassing a typical downtown city block of Little Rock, Arkansas, during the first half of the 20th century. The district consists of ten buildings lining the east side of the 300 block of Main Street. This area was completely redeveloped after a fire in February 1900 sparked an explosion at an arms company, levelling the block."}}
