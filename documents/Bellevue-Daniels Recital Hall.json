{"Bellevue": {"Daniels Recital Hall": "Daniels Recital Hall, formerly the First United Methodist Church, is a preserved church sanctuary that has been re-purposed into a recital hall. It was built in 1908 on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Marion Street in Seattle, Washington, United States. The recital hall opened in 2009 hosting concerts that use the already existing church acoustics."}}
