{"New_Britain": {"Pequabuck River": "The Pequabuck River is a river, approximately 19 miles (30.6 km) in length, which rises in Litchfield County, Connecticut and courses through neighboring Hartford County before emptying into the Farmington River in Farmington. The river has played a crucial role in the development of Plainville, Connecticut, in particular. The river's lower drainage basin consists of industrial and urban areas and effluents from these areas pollute the river's waters."}}
