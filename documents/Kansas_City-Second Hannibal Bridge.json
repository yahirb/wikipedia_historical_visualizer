{"Kansas_City": {"Second Hannibal Bridge": "The second Hannibal Bridge is a rail bridge over the Missouri River in Kansas City, Missouri connecting Jackson County, Missouri with Clay County, Missouri.\nOpened in 1917, the bridge replaced the original Hannibal Bridge which crossed the river about 200 feet downstream on the northern bank, but at virtually the same location on the southern bank. There are two decks on the bridge: the lower deck carried the railroad and the upper was for vehicular traffic."}}
