{"Oklahoma_City": {"Triangle District": "The Flatiron District (also sometimes called the Triangle District) in Oklahoma City is so named because several buildings in the district were built in a flatiron (triangular) architectural style due to Harrison Avenue diagonally intersecting the east-west and north-south streets of the district. The district is bounded by N.E. 4th St on the south, Interstate-235 on the east, the Santa Fe Railroad on the west and N.E. 9th St on the north. Like much of downtown Oklahoma City, the district was blighted for decades until the downtown renaissance began in the 1990s."}}
