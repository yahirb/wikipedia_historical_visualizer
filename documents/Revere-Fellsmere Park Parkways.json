{"Revere": {"Fellsmere Park Parkways": "Fellsmere Park is a historic park that was established in 1893 in Malden, Massachusetts, and designed by Charles Eliot for the city. In 1905 the city turned the park over to the Metropolitan Parks Commission (MPC, predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)). The MPC in 1913 designed the boundary roads of the park (West Border Road and Boundary Road), which were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2003 as Fellsmere Park Parkways."}}
