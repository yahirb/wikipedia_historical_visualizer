{"Lynn": {"North Street Fire Station": "The North Street Fire Station is a historic fire station at 142 North Street on the north side of Salem, Massachusetts, and one of the oldest active service fire stations in the United States. The brick Queen Anne structure was built in 1881 to a design by local architect William Dennis, and is the oldest active fire station in the city. It was the second brick fire station built by the city, its design similar to the first one, built for ward 5 in 1880 and destroyed in the Great Salem Fire of 1914."}}
