{"Minneapolis": {"Jay's Longhorn Bar": "Jay's Longhorn Bar, most frequently referred to by patrons as The Longhorn, was a nexus of the punk music scene in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, described by music critics as a \"legendary\" part of the genre's history and a \"punk rocker's paradise.\" One of the earliest clubs in America to regularly book punk, New Wave, and alternative-rock bands, the Longhorn was the only concert stage in Minnesota where touring acts in those genres could regularly perform until the opening of what would become First Avenue in 1980. \"The Police, Blondie, all the big acts played there,\" wrote H\u00fcsker D\u00fc guitarist Bob Mould, who frequented the venue and noted that he considered H\u00fcsker D\u00fc \"an actual band\" only after they had performed on the Longhorn stage. Robert Wilkinson, singer for Minneapolis punk band Flamingo, noted that in terms of importance to the scene, \u201cThe Longhorn was Minneapolis\u2019 CBGB\u2019s.\u201d\nThe Longhorn was also an important crucible of the local punk-rock scene."}}
