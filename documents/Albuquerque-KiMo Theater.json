{"Albuquerque": {"KiMo Theater": "The KiMo Theatre is a theatre located at 423 Central Avenue NW in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico and it is probably the city's best-known landmark. It was built in 1927 in the extravagant Art Deco-Pueblo Revival Style architecture, which is a blend of adobe building styles (rounded corners and edges), decorative motifs from indigenous cultures, and the soaring lines and linear repetition found in American Art Deco architecture.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe KiMo was conceived by entrepreneur Oreste Bachechi and his wife, Maria Franceschi Bachechi."}}
