{"Portland": {"Annie C. Maguire": "Annie C. Maguire was a British three-masted barque sailing from Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 24 December 1886 when she struck the ledge at Portland Head Light, Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Lighthouse Keeper Joshua Strout, his son, wife, and volunteers rigged an ordinary ladder as a gangplank between the shore and the ledge the ship was heeled against. Captain O'Neil, the ship's master, his wife, two mates, and the nine-man crew clambered onto the ledge and then, one by one, crossed the ladder to safety."}}
