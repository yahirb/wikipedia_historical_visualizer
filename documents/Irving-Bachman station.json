{"Irving": {"Bachman station": "Bachman station is a Dallas Area Rapid Transit station in Dallas, Texas. It serves DART's Green Line and Orange Line. The station opened as part of the Green Line's expansion in December 2010. It services nearby attractions such as Bachman Lake and surrounding neighborhoods. This is the last shared stop outbound between the Green and Orange Lines before the Orange Line branches off to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Because of this, it is one of the only three-platform DART stations."}}
