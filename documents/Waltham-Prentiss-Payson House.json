{"Waltham": {"Prentiss-Payson House": "The Prentiss-Payson House is a historic house at 224-226 Pleasant Street in Arlington, Massachusetts. This 2-1/2 story clapboarded wood frame house was built in 1856 for two women named Prentiss and Payson. Its massing and some of its styling is Italianate, but the front door surround, with sidelight and transom windows, pilasters, and triangular pediment, is distinctly Greek Revival in character."}}
