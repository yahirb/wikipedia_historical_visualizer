{"Rochester": {"Country Club of Rochester": "The Country Club of Rochester (CCR) is a championship golf course in the towns of Brighton and Pittsford, in suburban Rochester, New York. Members of the Genesee Valley Club founded the golf club in 1895, on a farm four miles east of downtown.\nThe original course was of a rather primitive design, reflective of the early era of golf."}}
