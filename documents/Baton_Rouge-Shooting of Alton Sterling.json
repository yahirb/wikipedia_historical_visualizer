{"Baton_Rouge": {"Shooting of Alton Sterling": "On July 5, 2016, Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, was shot several times at close range while held down on the ground by two Baton Rouge Police Department officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The officers were attepting to control Sterling's arms and he was shot after allegedly reaching for a gun in his pocket. Police were responding to a report that a man in a red shirt was selling CDs, and that he had used a gun to threaten a man outside a convenience store. The shooting was recorded by multiple bystanders.\nThe shooting led to protests in Baton Rouge and a request for a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThe Department of Justice investigated but in May 2017 decided that it would not file criminal charges against the police officers. After this decision was made by the Department of Justice, Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, said that the state of Louisiana would open an investigation into the shooting once the Department of Justice releases the physical evidence."}}
