{"Kirkland": {"Eastside (King County, Washington)": "The Eastside, in the context of the King County, Washington, United States area, is a collective term for the suburbs of Seattle located on the east side of Lake Washington. In this context, Westside is synonymous with Seattle. In Washington State more broadly, the term Eastside refers to the part of the state east of the passes over the Cascade Mountains, which can be a source of confusion since all of King County lies to the west of the Cascades."}}
