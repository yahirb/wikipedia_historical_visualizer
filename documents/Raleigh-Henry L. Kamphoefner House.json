{"Raleigh": {"Henry L. Kamphoefner House": "The Henry L. Kamphoefner House was the first Modernist house built in Raleigh, North Carolina. During the mid-20th century, faculty members from the School of Design located at North Carolina State College (now known as North Carolina State University) designed and built several modernist houses in Raleigh for themselves, other faculty, and a few clients. Henry L. Kamphoefner, originally the head of the University of Oklahoma's architecture program, became the first dean of the college's School of Design."}}
