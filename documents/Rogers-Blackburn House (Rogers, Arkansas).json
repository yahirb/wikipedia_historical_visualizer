{"Rogers": {"Blackburn House (Rogers, Arkansas)": "The Blackburn House is a historic house at 220 North Fourth Street in Rogers, Arkansas. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a stone foundation, with a busy roofline typical of Late Victorian styling, but with more stylistically Classical Revival features, such as turned columns supporting its wraparound porch. The house was built in 1907 by J. A. C. Blackburn, a lumber baron who controlled much of the timber industry in northwestern Arkansas."}}
