{"Pueblo": {"Colorado Fuel and Iron": "The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) was a large steel concentration. By 1903, it was largely owned and controlled by John D. Rockefeller and Jay Gould's financial heirs. While it came to control many plants throughout the country, its main plant was a steel mill on the south side of Pueblo, Colorado and was the city's main industry for most of its history."}}
