{"Cedar_Park": {"Leanderthal Lady": "Leanderthal Lady, discovered in January 1983, is the skeletal remains of a prehistoric woman found at the Wilson-Leonard Brushy Creek Site (an ancient Native American campsite) in the city of Cedar Park, Texas, by the Texas Department of Transportation. The remains were also alternatively labeled \"Leanne\". Both names were inspired by the proximity of the site to the town of Leander, to the north."}}
