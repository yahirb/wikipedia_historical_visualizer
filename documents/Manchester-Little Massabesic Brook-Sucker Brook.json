{"Manchester": {"Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook": "Little Massabesic Brook and Sucker Brook form a 1.9-mile-long (3.1 km) stream located in southern New Hampshire in the United States. They are tributaries of Massabesic Lake, part of the Merrimack River and Gulf of Maine watersheds. Despite the streams' short length, they are subject to the New Hampshire Comprehensive Shoreland Protection Act, because of their fourth order stream status (indicating a high number of upstream tributary sets)."}}
