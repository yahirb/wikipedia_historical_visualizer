{"New_Haven": {"City Point, New Haven": "City Point (formerly known as Oyster Point) is an area in what is now The Hill neighborhood of the city of New Haven, Connecticut, located in the southwestern portion of the city. The City Point area was, when settled and through the 18th century, a relatively narrow peninsula extending south into New Haven Harbor, located where the West River empties into the harbor. Areas adjacent to the original peninsula have since been filled in, broadening its shoulders, and Interstate 95 has cut across it."}}
