{"Camden": {"Royal Theater (Philadelphia)": "The Royal Theater was a center of African American culture in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Built in 1919, by the 1930s the theater had earned the reputation as \"America's Finest Colored Photoplayhouse\". The theater closed in 1970, after attendance dwindled and the threat of the Crosstown Expressway had decimated the neighborhood."}}
