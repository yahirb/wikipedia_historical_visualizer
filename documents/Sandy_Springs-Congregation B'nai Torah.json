{"Sandy_Springs": {"Congregation B'nai Torah": "Congregation B'nai Torah is a Conservative synagogue located in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States. It was founded in 1981 by young, unaffiliated Jews who had attended the Hillel High holiday services at Emory University since the 1970s. The 125 member families met in a closed grammar school until 1984, and then for two years in trailers, until they constructed a synagogue building."}}
