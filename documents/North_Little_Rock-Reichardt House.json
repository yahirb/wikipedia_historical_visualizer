{"North_Little_Rock": {"Reichardt House": "The Reichardt House is a historic house at 1201 Welch Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. Built in 1870 and significantly altered in subsequent decades, it is now a two-story five-bay wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and weatherboard siding. A central gabled section projects from the front, and a single-story porch wraps across the front, supported by delicate turned posts."}}
