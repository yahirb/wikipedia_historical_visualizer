{"Great_Falls": {"Hill 57": "Hill 57 is a sandstone-capped hill on the benchland northwest of Great Falls, Montana, United States. The origin of the name is in dispute, but probably derives from an advertisement for \"Heinz 57\" food products that was created on the hillside in the early 20th century. Hill 57 was home to a small and poverty-stricken community of Cree, M\u00e9tis, and Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) Native Americans from about the 1880s to the 1960s."}}
