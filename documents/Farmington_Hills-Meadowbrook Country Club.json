{"Farmington_Hills": {"Meadowbrook Country Club": "Meadowbrook Country Club is a country club in Northville Township, Wayne County, near Northville, Michigan. The idea for Meadowbrook Country Club, a private golf and social club, came about in 1916 when 23 Northville businessmen purchased 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the Fred C. Cochran Farm. The club was named after a brook, which ran through the property."}}
