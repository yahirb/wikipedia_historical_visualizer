{"Vancouver": {"Wapato Corrections Facility": "Wapato Corrections Facility is a Multnomah County jail constructed in 2003 in the far corner of North Portland, Oregon. The jail was funded in 1996 by a bond measure defined by Multnomah County Commissioners in 1996 in Resolution 96-122, and promoted by District Attorney Mike Schrunk and law enforcement as a response to Measure 11.\nAs of 2017, budget limitations have prevented the county from opening the facility and it has never housed an inmate, getting only incidental use such as for movie shoots."}}
