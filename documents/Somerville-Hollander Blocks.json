{"Somerville": {"Hollander Blocks": "The Hollander Blocks are a pair of historic apartment houses at 56-58 Walnut Street and 4-6 Pleasant Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts. The two adjacent buildings were constructed in the early 1890s by Clarence T. Hollander on land that had been subdivided in the 1870s, and purchased by his father as an investment. The properties (one with 10 units, the other 12) stand out in a neighborhood otherwise dominated by single family residences."}}
