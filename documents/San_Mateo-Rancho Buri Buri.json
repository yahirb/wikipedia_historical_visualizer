{"San_Mateo": {"Rancho Buri Buri": "Rancho Buri Buri (also called S\u00e1nchez Rancho) was a 14,639-acre (59.24 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day San Mateo County, California, given in 1835 by Governor Jos\u00e9 Castro to Jos\u00e9 Antonio S\u00e1nchez. The name derives from the Urebure village of the Ramaytush speaking Yelamu tribe of Ohlone people who were settled by the banks of San Bruno Creek. Rancho Buri Buri extended between the north line of South San Francisco and the middle of Burlingame, and from the San Francisco Bay to the top of the Peninsula ridge and included present-day Lomita Park, Millbrae, South San Francisco, San Bruno, and the northern part of Burlingame."}}
