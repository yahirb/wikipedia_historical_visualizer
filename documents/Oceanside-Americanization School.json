{"Oceanside": {"Americanization School": "In countries outside the United States of America, Americanization or Americanisation is the influence American culture and business has on other countries, such as their media, cuisine, business practices, popular culture, technology, or political techniques. The term has been used since at least 1907. While not necessarily a pejorative term, it is most often used by critics in the target country who are against the influences."}}
