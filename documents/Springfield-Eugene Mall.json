{"Springfield": {"Eugene Mall": "The Eugene Mall was a car-free zone in the heart of Eugene, Oregon, designed to encourage pedestrian access to shopping and entertainment areas. Dedicated on February 13, 1971, the mall opened amid three days of fanfare and dreams of a revitalized downtown. Conflict over the scope and use of the mall began immediately and continued for 30 years until the last remaining parts of the mall were opened to automobile traffic."}}
