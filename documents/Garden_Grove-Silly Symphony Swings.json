{"Garden_Grove": {"Silly Symphony Swings": "Silly Symphony Swings is a wave swinger attraction in Paradise Pier at the Disneyland Resort in California. Themed to Disney's 1935 short film The Band Concert, Mickey Mouse conducts from high atop the attraction, synchronized with the music. Although The Band Concert was not part of the Silly Symphonies film series, the name was applied to the attraction as a result of its symphony storyline."}}
