{"Portland": {"Portland Breakwater Light": "The Portland Breakwater Light (also called Bug Light) is a small lighthouse in South Portland, Maine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lighthouse was first built in 1855, as a wooden structure, but the breakwater was extended and a new lighthouse was constructed at the end of it in 1875. The new lighthouse was made of curved cast-iron plates whose seams are disguised by six decorative Corinthian columns."}}
