{"Duluth": {"Duluth Ship Canal": "The Duluth Ship Canal is an artificial channel cut through Minnesota Point, providing direct access to Duluth harbor from Lake Superior. Begun privately in 1871, it was put under federal supervision and maintenance several years later. It is still an important component of the harbor facilities."}}
