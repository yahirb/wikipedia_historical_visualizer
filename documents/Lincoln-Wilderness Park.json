{"Lincoln": {"Wilderness Park": "Wilderness Park is a 1,472-acre (596 ha) mostly-public conservancy located in southwest Lincoln, Nebraska. There are many separate branches of the park, some separated by roads including prominently S 14th St, a north-south street which dissects much of the south end of the park. The park is heavily wooded, but also includes some prairieland.\nBoundaries are S 1st St on the west, S 27th St on the east, Van Dorn St on the north and Saltillo Rd on the south - however, not nearly all of the land between these boundaries resides in the park. The park is much wider in the southern segments. Among smaller streams, Beal Slough, a primary tributary to Salt Creek, passes through Wilderness Park.\nWilderness is the largest city park in Lincoln."}}
