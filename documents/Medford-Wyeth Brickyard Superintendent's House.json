{"Medford": {"Wyeth Brickyard Superintendent's House": "The Wyeth Brickyard Superintendent's House is an historic house at 336 Rindge Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built c. 1848, this modest brick 1.5 story worker's house is one of the few reminders of the once-thriving 19th century brick industry of North Cambridge."}}
