{"Worcester": {"Patrick McGrath Three-Decker": "The Patrick McGrath Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 50 Dorchester Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built in 1894, during an early phase of development in the Grafton Hill area, and was highlighted for its Queen Anne styling when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Exterior details, notably an ornately decorated three-tier porch, have since been lost (see photo)."}}
