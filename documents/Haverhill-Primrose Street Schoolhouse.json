{"Haverhill": {"Primrose Street Schoolhouse": "The Primrose Street Schoolhouse is a historic school building at 71 Primrose Street in Haverhill, Massachusetts. The two story brick building was designed by Haverhill architect Josiah M. Littlefield and built in 1868 to meet increased demand for schooling occasioned by an influx of French Canadian families, and served as a public school until the 1890s. It was sold by the city in 1909, at which time it was converted into a multifamily residence."}}
