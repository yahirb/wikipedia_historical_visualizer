{"Mount_Vernon": {"Our Lady of the Nativity of Our Blessed Lady's Church (Bronx, New York)": "The Nativity of Our Blessed Lady is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 1510 East 233rd Street and the corner of Secor Avenue, Bronx, New York in the Eastchester neighborhood of the northern Bronx. The church was designed by Don Shepherd, a designer and not an architect. The AIA Guide to New York City described it as \"a minor work but one which calls attention to itself because of its location and the rusted steel crucifix that dominates the corner of the site.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original church of this parish was erected in 1924 (just across the street from its current location) where the playground area of The Nativity of Our Blessed Lady School (3893 Dyre Avenue) is located."}}
