{"National_City": {"One America Plaza": "One America Plaza is the tallest building in San Diego, California and a prominent fixture in the waterfront district of the downtown San Diego skyline. The 34-story, 500 ft (150 m), 623,000 sq ft (57,900 m2), obelisk-shaped tower was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn Architects and KMA Architecture. The top of the building bears a striking resemblance to the end of a Phillips head screwdriver and has a similar appearance to Two Liberty Place in Philadelphia also designed by Jahn, which is a year older."}}
