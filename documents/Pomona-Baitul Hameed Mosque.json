{"Pomona": {"Baitul Hameed Mosque": "The Baitul Hameed Mosque (English: House of the Praiseworthy) is the largest Ahmadiyya Muslim mosque in the Western part of the United States with an area of 19,000 square feet (1,800 m2) sitting on nearly 5 acres (20,000 m2). Initially built in 1989 at a cost of $2.5 million, entirely from donations of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, it is located east of Los Angeles in Chino, California, just inside San Bernardino County. The San Gabriel Mountains provide a beautiful backdrop to this Spanish-inspired mosque with modern amenities. In 2003, an electrical fire caused heavy damage to the front building which was used for library and office space, as well as a kitchen. The affected areas were demolished, and rebuilt with a second story. In addition, a separate auxiliary hall was built adjacent to the existing Tahir Hall, for the exclusive use of Lajna Imaillah. The reconstructed mosque opened again for full use in August, 2009. A separate commercial kitchen and missionary residence / guest house are also on site. Plans are now underway for the construction of a NCAA sized basketball court with space allocated in the back lot."}}
