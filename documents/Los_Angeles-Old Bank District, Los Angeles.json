{"Los_Angeles": {"Old Bank District, Los Angeles": "Located in the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, the Old Bank District is a group of early 20th century commercial buildings, many of which have been (or are being) converted into residential (loft) use. The Old Bank District is bordered roughly by the Jewelry District, the Fashion District, Gallery Row, the Toy District, and the city's Civic Center - specifically the block from Main to Spring streets between 4th and 5th.\nThough the name suggests a subdistrict of the city, it is actually the name of the residential conversion project proposed by developer Tom Gilmore in 1998."}}
