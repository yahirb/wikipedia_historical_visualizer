{"Omaha": {"Freedom Park (Omaha, Nebraska)": "Freedom Park is an outdoor park and museum at the Greater Omaha Marina on the bank of the Missouri River at 2497 Freedom Park Road in the East Omaha section of Omaha, Nebraska. It displays numerous military aircraft and artillery pieces along with its two major exhibits, the World War II minesweeper USS Hazard (AM-240) and Cold War-era training submarine USS Marlin (SST-2). The park closed as a result of flooding along the Missouri River in 2011, but reopened on October 7, 2015 after four years of restoration and cleanup work."}}
