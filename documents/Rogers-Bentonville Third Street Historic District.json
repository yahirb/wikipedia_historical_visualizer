{"Rogers": {"Bentonville Third Street Historic District": "The Bentonville Third Street Historic District is a residential historic district just southeast of the central business district of Bentonville, Arkansas. It covers two blocks of SE Third Street, between Main and B Streets, including fourteen properties on Third Street and adjacent cross streets. This area, developed principally after the arrival in Bentonville of the railroad in 1881, is reflective of the high-style architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that had not previously been widespread in Benton County."}}
