{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Maplewood High School (Tennessee)": "Maplewood High School is a secondary education facility operated by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. It is located barely one-fourth mile east of Nashville\u2019s historic Dickerson Road and borders on Ellington Parkway on the west. The school was formerly called Maplewood Comprehensive High School until March 2012 when the Metro Board of Education dropped the \"Comprehensive\" title from all its zoned schools to reflect the district's new emphases on smaller learning communities and thematic career academies."}}
