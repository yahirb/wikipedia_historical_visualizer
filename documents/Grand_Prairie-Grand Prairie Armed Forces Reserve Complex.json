{"Grand_Prairie": {"Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Complex": "The Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Complex (formerly Naval Air Station Dallas or Hensley Field) is a former United States Navy Naval Air Station located on Mountain Creek Lake in southwest Dallas. The installation was originally established as an Army Aviation center, and eventually became home to aviation assets from all the military services. The facility was decommissioned as a naval air station in December 1998 pursuant to BRAC action and the extant Naval Air Reserve, Marine Air Reserve and Texas Air National Guard flying units (wings, groups, squadrons) relocating to the nearby former Carswell AFB, which was concurrently transferred to U.S. Navy custody via the Base Realignment and Closure Commission action and renamed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth / Carswell Field."}}
