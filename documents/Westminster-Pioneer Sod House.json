{"Westminster": {"Pioneer Sod House": "The Pioneer Sod House in Wheat Ridge, Colorado is a sod house built in 1886 or perhaps well before. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nSod houses were rare in the Denver area, as lumber was available, and this is likely the only one surviving."}}
