{"Pleasanton": {"Pleasanton Ridge Regional Park": "\n== History ==\nPleasanton Ridge Regional Park, located west of the I-680 freeway and the City of Pleasanton, California, became a reality in 1988, when the East Bay Regional Park District bought 1,700 acres (6.9 km2) to start what would become its second-largest park. In 1980, a real estate developer had proposed building a golf course and a number of new homes atop Pleasanton Ridge. A large number of area residents opposed the proposal and defeated it in a referendum in 1983."}}
