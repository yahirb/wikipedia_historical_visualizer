{"Huntington_Beach": {"Huntington Beach Public Library": "The Huntington Beach Public Library and Cultural Center (HBPL) is located in Huntington Beach, California. This medium-sized public library offers online databases, print and electronic books and magazines, children's programs, computer lab, DVD movies, CD music and books on CD for anyone with a Huntington Beach library card. Library cards are free to California residents. Free wireless access is available at all locations without a card. The library is financed and governed by the City of Huntington Beach, California. Volunteers also subsidize the library system by selling used books, operating a gift shop, and running charitable events. In 2015 volunteers donated 57,731 hours towards the library. The first library in Huntington Beach opened in 1909 and has since evolved to a five-location library system: Central, Main Street, Oak View, Helen Murphy, and Banning."}}
