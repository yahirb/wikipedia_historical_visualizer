{"Baltimore": {"Henry Fite House": "The \"Henry Fite House\", located on West Baltimore Street (then known as Market Street), between South Sharp and North Liberty Streets (also later known as Hopkins Place), in Baltimore, Maryland, was the meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from December 20, 1776 until February 22, 1777. Built as a tavern in 1770 by Henry Fite (1722\u20131789), the building became known as \"Congress Hall\" during its brief use by Congress, and later in local history as \"Old Congress Hall\". It was destroyed by the Great Baltimore Fire on Sunday and Monday, February 7\u20138, 1904, which started a block to the southwest at North Liberty (east of North Howard) and German (later West Redwood) Streets at the John E. Hurst Company building (dry goods) and swept north to Fayette Street and finally to the east to the Jones Falls, burning most of the downtown central business district and waterfront, of which only a few modern \"fire-proof\" skyscrapers, though burned, had enough structural support left to save, rebuild and restore later."}}
