{"West_Allis": {"Milwaukee Center": "The Milwaukee Center is a 28-story, 426-foot-tall (130 m) postmodern high-rise building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The building was completed in 1988, during a small building boom in Milwaukee that also included 100 East Wisconsin. Until 100 East was completed, the Milwaukee Center was the second tallest building in Milwaukee."}}
