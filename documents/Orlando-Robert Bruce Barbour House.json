{"Orlando": {"Robert Bruce Barbour House": "The Robert Bruce Barbour House, also known as Casa Feliz (Happy House;) is a restored Spanish farmhouse designed by architect James Gamble Rogers II, overlooking the golf course in the heart of Winter Park, Florida. This is one of Rogers' best-known residences. In 2000 order to save it from destruction, the city of Winter Park moved it to its current location at 656 Park Avenue North in Winter Park."}}
