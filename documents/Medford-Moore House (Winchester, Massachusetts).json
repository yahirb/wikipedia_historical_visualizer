{"Medford": {"Moore House (Winchester, Massachusetts)": "The Moore House is a historic house at 85 Walnut Street in Winchester, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story Gothic Revival house was probably built sometime in the 1840s, possibly by George Moore, a local builder whose family was listed as resident there 1865-1931. The house is distinctive for having three steeply pitched gable dormers in front, decorated with vergeboard, and for a small mansard-roofed tower added to the rear in the 1870s."}}
