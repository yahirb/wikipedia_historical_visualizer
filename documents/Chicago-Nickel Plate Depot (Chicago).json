{"Chicago": {"Nickel Plate Depot (Chicago)": "The passenger depot of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) in Chicago, Illinois was located at the northwest corner of Roosevelt Road (12th Street) and Clark Street, just east of the main line of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway to its LaSalle Street Station. Between 1897 and 1928, the Nickel Plate became a tenant at LaSalle, which it continued to use until its passenger service was abandoned."}}
