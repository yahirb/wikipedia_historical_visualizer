{"Boston": {"International Trust Company Building": "The International Trust Company Building is an historic office building at 39-47 Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The nine-story masonry-clad building was built in 1892-93 to a design by William Gibbons Preston. It is an early example in the city of Beaux Arts style, and is structurally an early prototype of the use of skeleton framing. It was enlarged in 1906, to a design by Woodbury & Leighton. It was connected by internal connections to the adjacent Compton Building in 1961, when the two buildings were under common ownership.\nThe building was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1978. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979."}}
