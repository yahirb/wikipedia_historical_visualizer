{"Atlanta": {"Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing": "The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology has roots stretching back to an Information Science degree established in 1964. In 1988, Georgia Tech president John Patrick Crecine elevated the School of Information and Computer Science to become the College of Computing, making Georgia Tech the second university to do so, after Carnegie Mellon University created their School of Computer Science.\nBeyond using contemporary computer technology, the College of Computing also seeks new concepts and technology, with symbiotic connections to departments in other Colleges of Georgia Tech, in a holistic manner, such as combining with studies in human psychology, medical science, liberal arts, and business (e-commerce)."}}
