{"Camden": {"Fashion District Philadelphia": "Fashion District Philadelphia is a revitalization zone to be anchored by a renovated mall at the former site of The Gallery at Market East. The area was originally planned to be an outlet mall to be called \"Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia\", but the plans were later changed to be a new \"retail district\" consisting of clothing stores and a movie theater. Tenants such as H&M and various other chains have signed leases."}}
