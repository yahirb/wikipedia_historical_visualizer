{"Yuba_City": {"Yuba Sutter Mall": "The Yuba Sutter Mall (formerly called The Mall at Yuba City) is a single-level shopping mall located in Yuba City, California, opening on March 7, 1990. The name of the mall changed on June 24, 2005 after a mild renovation and it serves as the regional mall for the Yuba-Sutter area. The mall moved from Yuba County to the current Sutter County location after the Peach Tree Mall suffered damage from the February 20, 1986 flood."}}
