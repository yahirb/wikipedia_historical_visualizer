{"Gilbert": {"Agritopia": "Agritopia is a 166-acre mixed use planned community in Gilbert, Arizona designed to encourage agrarianism combined with a sense of community amongst the socioeconomic ranges. Homes ranging from 1300 square feet to 7,000 square feet reside next to each other, some with full basements and some without. Narrow streets and front porches, with low back fences, encourage neighborly socialization, and is reminiscent of the mid-west in the 1950s."}}
