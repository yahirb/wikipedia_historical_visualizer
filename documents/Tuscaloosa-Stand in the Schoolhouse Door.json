{"Tuscaloosa": {"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door": "The Stand in the Schoolhouse Door took place at Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. George Wallace, the Democratic Governor of Alabama, in a symbolic attempt to keep his inaugural promise of \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" and stop the desegregation of schools, stood at the door of the auditorium to try to block the entry of two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood.\nIn response, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11111, which federalized the Alabama National Guard, and Guard General Henry Graham then commanded Wallace to step aside, saying, \"Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States.\" Wallace then spoke further, but eventually moved, and Malone and Hood completed their registration."}}
