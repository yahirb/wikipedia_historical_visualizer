{"Worcester": {"Boynton and Windsor": "The Boynton and The Windsor are a pair historic buildings at 718 and 720 Main Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. They are nearly identical brick apartment buildings that were constructed c. 1887 to designs by Barker & Nourse, and are well preserved instances of late 19th century apartment house construction that once lined Main Street for many blocks."}}
