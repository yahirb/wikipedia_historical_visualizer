{"Waltham": {"Morton Road Historic District": "The Morton Road Historic District encompasses an example of a small residential subdivision in Newton, Massachusetts that was attractively designed in 1915. The architect-designed subdivision filled in an area otherwise surrounded by roads that had been developed earlier, and was built out between 1915 and 1928, with a fairly uniform use of Craftsman and Tudor Revival styling. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990."}}
