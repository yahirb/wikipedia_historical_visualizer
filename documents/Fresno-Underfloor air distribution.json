{"Fresno": {"Underfloor air distribution": "Underfloor air distribution (UFAD) is an air distribution strategy for providing ventilation and space conditioning in buildings as part of the design of an HVAC system. UFAD systems use an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building. Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristic of UFAD system, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH)."}}
