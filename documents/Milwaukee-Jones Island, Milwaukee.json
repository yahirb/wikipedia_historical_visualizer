{"Milwaukee": {"Jones Island, Milwaukee": "Jones Island is an industrialized peninsula in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It began as a marsh island between the Milwaukee and Kinnickinnic rivers, and now forms the city's inner harbor design.\n\n\n== History ==\nExtensive filling and channelization of the area began in the mid-19th century when city co-founder Byron Kilbourn advocated a \"straight cut\" from the Milwaukee River near the Menomonee River confluence out to Lake Michigan."}}
