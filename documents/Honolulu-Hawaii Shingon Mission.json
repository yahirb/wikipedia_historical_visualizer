{"Honolulu": {"Hawaii Shingon Mission": "Hawaii Shingon Mission or Shingon Shu Hawaii (formerly the Shingon Sect Mission of Hawaii) located at 915 Sheridan Street in Honolulu, Hawaii, is one of the most elaborate displays of Japanese Buddhist temple architecture in Hawai\u02bbi. It was first built in 1915-1918 by Nakagawa Katsutaro, a master builder of Japanese-style temples, then renovated in 1929 by Hego Fuchino, a self-taught man who was the first person of Japanese ancestry to become a licensed architect in the Islands. The building underwent further changes in 1978, and was considerably augmented in 1992."}}
