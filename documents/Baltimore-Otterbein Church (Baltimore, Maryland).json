{"Baltimore": {"Otterbein Church (Baltimore, Maryland)": "Otterbein Church, now known as Old Otterbein United Methodist Church, is a historic United Brethren church located in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The first \"German Reformed\" church was built to serve the German Reformed and some Evangelical Lutheran immigrants, and later entered the Brethren strain of German Reformed Protestantism in the later Church of the United Brethren in Christ. It is a two-story brick Georgian structure with a peaked roof, built 1785-1786, and features a square bell tower and an octagonal white \"cupola-on-cupola\", with much of the original wavy, hand-blown glass window panes still remaining."}}
