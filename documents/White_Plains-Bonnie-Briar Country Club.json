{"White_Plains": {"Bonnie-Briar Country Club": "Bonnie-Briar County Club is an 18-hole golf course and country club located in the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. The course architect was A. W. Tillinghast, one of the most prolific architects in the history of golf, and designer of nearby Southern Westchester courses including Quaker Ridge Golf Club, Wykagyl Country Club and Winged Foot Golf Club. The course design made excellent use of Bonnie Briar's hilly and low wetland areas, surrounding a wooded interior."}}
