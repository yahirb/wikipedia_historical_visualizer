{"Albany": {"Little Willamette River": "The Little Willamette River is a minor tributary of the Willamette River in Linn County in the U.S. state of Oregon. It begins in a gravel pit slightly east of the main stem in a bend of the larger river west of Albany. Flowing generally northeast and roughly parallel to the main stem for about 3 miles (5 km), it enters the Willamette about 121.5 miles (195.5 km) from the larger river's mouth on the Columbia River."}}
