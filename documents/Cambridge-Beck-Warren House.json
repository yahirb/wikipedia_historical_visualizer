{"Cambridge": {"Beck-Warren House": "The Beck-Warren House, also known just as the Warren House, is an historic house on 1 Prescott Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Now on the campus of Harvard University, this large Greek Revival wood frame house was built in 1833 for Professor Charles Beck, and was later purchased and adapted by the physically disabled Henry Clarke Warren, a Sanskrit scholar. Since 1899 it has belonged to Harvard University, for whom it presently houses offices."}}
