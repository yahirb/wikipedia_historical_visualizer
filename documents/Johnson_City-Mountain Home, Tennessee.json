{"Johnson_City": {"Mountain Home, Tennessee": "My Tennessee Mountain Home, released in 1973, is the 11th solo studio album by Dolly Parton, the title track of which became one of her better-known compositions. Largely a concept album about her childhood in rural East Tennessee, the album began with a recitation of the first letter Parton wrote to her parents, shortly after moving from her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee to Nashville in 1964. Most of the songs were fond reminiscences of her youth and family, though in one song, \"In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)\", Parton candidly admits that though she is grateful for the lessons the poverty of her childhood taught her, she is in no hurry to repeat the experience."}}
