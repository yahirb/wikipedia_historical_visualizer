{"Pittsburgh": {"Grant Street Station": "Grant Street Station, also known as the B&O Pittsburgh Terminal, was a passenger rail station on Grant Street downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) announced plans for it on May 3, 1955, after selling the original B&O Station bordering the Monongahela River to the state for construction of Interstate 376. It opened in 1957 to serve commuter rail traffic; all intercity traffic continued to use the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's (P&LE) station (now called Station Square)."}}
