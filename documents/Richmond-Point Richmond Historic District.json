{"Richmond": {"Point Richmond Historic District": "The Point Richmond Historic District is the downtown area of Point Richmond in Richmond, California, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis historic district developed in the late 1890s when the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway occupied 57 acres (230,000 m2) of land in the area that is now the neighborhood downtown of Point Richmond. The acres were bought by the Santa Fe Railroad upon completion and at the same time the Pacific Coast Oil Company (later Standard Oil, today Chevron) acquired adjacent lands and built an oil refinery."}}
