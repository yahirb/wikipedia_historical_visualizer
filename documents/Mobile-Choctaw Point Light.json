{"Mobile": {"Choctaw Point Light": "The Choctaw Point Light was a lighthouse located just south of Mobile, Alabama on the west shore of Mobile Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\nMobile Bay is quite shallow, and dredging began in 1826 using a machine developed by John Grant, a sea captain in the area. The channel opened the city up to greater traffic and in 1831 a brick tower was constructed on Choctaw Point, which projected from the west shore somewhat south of town."}}
