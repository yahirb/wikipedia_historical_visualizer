{"New_Orleans": {"American Chicle Company Building": "American Chicle Company Building is located in the Gert Town neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana.\nThe New Orleans Chamber of Commerce started campaigning for a chewing gum factory in the city in 1900. Points in favor of New Orleans as a good location for such a factory included being USA's leading port of commerce with Latin America, so much chicle was already shipped through there, and large quantities of sugar are grown and refined in Louisiana."}}
