{"Cleveland": {"Coventry Village": "Coventry Village is a commercial business district in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, situated on Coventry Road between Mayfield Road (U.S. Route 322) and Euclid Heights Boulevard. Coventry is associated with Northeast Ohio's artistic, musical, bohemian, hippie and emerging hipster communities and is the center of Cleveland's creative class, inviting comparisons to the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Greenwich Village in New York City, although on a smaller scale.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe road bisecting what is now Coventry Village appeared in the Titus Atlas of 1874 as an unidentified north-south route."}}
