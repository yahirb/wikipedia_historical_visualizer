{"Lowell": {"Warren Fox Building": "The Warren Fox Building is a historic commercial building at 190\u2013196 Middlesex Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The four story brick building was built in 1884 by Warren Fox, and is a good example of commercial Queen Anne architecture. The building is nine bays wide; brick piers rise surrounding the central bay, where the main entrance is, and rise above the level of the flat roof to form a cornice."}}
