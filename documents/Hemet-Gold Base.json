It is located at 19712 Gilman Springs Rd, San Jacinto in Riverside County, California (though technically it lies within the unincorporated county area of Gilman Hot Springs and not within the city limits of San Jacinto) and about 100 miles (160 km) from Los Angeles. The heavily guarded compound comprises about 50 buildings surrounded by high fences topped with blades and watched around the clock by patrols, cameras and motion detectors."}}
