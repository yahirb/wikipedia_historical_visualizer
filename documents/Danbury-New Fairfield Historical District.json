{"Danbury": {"New Fairfield Historical District": "The New Fairfield Historical District is in New Fairfield, Connecticut. In 2005, the newly created state-funded Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism awarded its first Endangered Properties Grant to the Town of New Fairfield. The $50,000 grant was used to relocate and preserve the Parsonage and the Gideon Hubbell House, two historically significant State Register properties threatened with demolition."}}
