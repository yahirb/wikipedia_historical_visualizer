{"Albuquerque": {"ATLAS-I": "The Atlas I was an American expendable launch system, used in the 1990s to launch a variety of different satellites. The \"I\" in \"Atlas I\" can cause confusion, as all previous Atlas rockets were designated using letters, ending with the Atlas H, however subsequent rockets were designated using Roman numerals, starting with the Atlas II. Officially, the \"I\" is the Roman numeral \"1\". Eleven launches took place, with three failures."}}
