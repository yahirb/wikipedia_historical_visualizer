According to U.S. News & World Report, 80% of 2010 graduates participated in international programs, which is the sixth highest percentage of students from any higher education institution in the US to study abroad.\nSince at least the late 1960s, the University of Dallas has consistently been mentioned as one of the leading Universities for both Catholic orthodoxy and traditional academic excellence. The college has been especially praised for its conservative cultural perspective by many leading voices in political conservatism for most of its history. William F. Buckley, Brad Miner, and Pat Buchanan are just a few of the American conservative leaders who have spoken at UD over the years.\nThe university comprises four academic units: the Braniff Graduate School of Liberal Arts, the Constantin College of Liberal Arts, the Satish & Yasmin Gupta College of Business, and the School of Ministry.\nDallas offers several master's degree programs and a doctoral degree program with three concentrations. There are 136 full-time faculty and 102 part-time faculty, and the school has an 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio."}}
