{"Medford": {"Langmaid Building": "The Langmaid Building is a historic multiunit residence building at 48\u2013 52 Highland Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts, USA. The brick rowhouse was one of several Second Empire multiunit buildings built in the late 1870s and early 1880s by Samuel Langmaid and other members of his family. This particular series of units has decorative panel brick insets, and the characteristic slate mansard roof. This building was the first to be built of brick in the area, marking a shift away from wood frame construction that dominated the area."}}
