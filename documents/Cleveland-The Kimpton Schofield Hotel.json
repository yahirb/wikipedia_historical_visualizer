{"Cleveland": {"The Kimpton Schofield Hotel": "Kimpton Schofield Hotel (previously known as the Schofield Building and Euclid Ninth Tower) is an historic building located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. The 172-foot, 14-story high-rise is located at the corner of East Ninth Street and Euclid Avenue in the city's Nine-Twelve District, alongside other historic buildings such as Rose Building, the City Club Building, the Union Commerce Building, the Cleveland Trust Company Building, The 9 Cleveland and The Cleveland Athletic Club Building. Originally constructed as an office building, the Schofield underwent an extensive five-year restoration and renovation to convert the building to a hotel-residential building scheduled to open in March 2016. \nThe Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group oversaw the $50 million project to restore the exterior of a Cleveland landmark to its original early-20th-century appearance. In this new configuration, the Schofield's first seven floors will have 122 hotel rooms and six suites, with the upper seven floors housing 52 apartments of varying sizes."}}
