{"Cicero": {"WRLL": "WRLL (1450 AM) is a regional Mexican radio station licensed to Cicero, Illinois, and serving the Chicago market. It shares time with WCEV, which broadcasts over the same facilities.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006, WVON, which had long operated on 1450 AM, moved to 1690 AM. The WRLL callsign, which had been held by the original station on 1690 AM, \"Real Oldies 1690\", was shifted to 1450, and the station adopted a Spanish-language format called \"Radio Latino\"."}}
