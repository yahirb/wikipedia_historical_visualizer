{"Camden": {"Pomona Hall": "Pomona Hall is a colonial mansion located at 1900 Park Boulevard and Euclid Avenue, in Camden, Camden County, New Jersey, United States, that operates as a museum by the Camden County Historical Society. The first building on the site was constructed in 1718, while construction of the more substantial mansion house was started in 1726, with later additions made in 1788. It is not known when the house was first called Pomona Hall; but it is marked on Hill's Map of Philadelphia and Environs, published in 1809."}}
