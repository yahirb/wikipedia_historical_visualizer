{"New_Bedford": {"Ash Street Jail": "The Ash Street Jail and Regional Lock-Up, located in New Bedford, Massachusetts, is a jail for inmates who are awaiting trial from Bristol County, MA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ash Street Jail was built in 1888 on the site of the New Bedford House of Correction and the former New Bedford County Jail that was built in 1829. It is currently overseen by Bristol County Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson, who feels that although he has been heavily criticized for keeping the 180-year-old facility open, that keeping it open is a good idea because jail should be a place that \"people don't want to return\". Due to alleged unsafe conditions, including the absence of automatic door locks, the jail has been the subject of lawsuits."}}
