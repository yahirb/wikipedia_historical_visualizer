{"Alexandria": {"United States Patent and Trademark Office": "The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that issues patents to inventors and businesses for their inventions, and trademark registration for product and intellectual property identification.\nThe USPTO is \"unique among federal agencies because it operates solely on fees collected by its users, and not on taxpayer dollars\". Its \"operating structure is like a business in that it receives requests for services\u2014applications for patents and trademark registrations\u2014and charges fees projected to cover the cost of performing the services [it] provide[s]\"."}}
