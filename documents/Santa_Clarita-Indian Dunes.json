{"Santa_Clarita": {"Indian Dunes": "Indian Dunes was a 600 acres (2.4 km2) film ranch owned by Newhall Land & Farming Company. Located near the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California, it was a favorite of filmmakers for its versatility and location within the thirty-mile zone until its owners returned the site to farming in 1990 following a reduced interest in the kind of action television programs and films that had been produced there. The company reportedly grossed up to $600,000 (US Dollars, 1990) annually at one time."}}
