{"Hoboken": {"R. C. Williams Warehouse": "The R.C. Williams Warehouse is a Modern Movement style building in New York City designed by architect Cass Gilbert. It was built on the west side of 10th Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets, for a wholesale grocery company, the R.C. Williams Company, which began in 1809. The design is a smaller version of Gilbert's design for the U.S. Army Military Ocean Terminal."}}
