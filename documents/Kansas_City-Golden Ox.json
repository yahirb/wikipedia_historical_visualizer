{"Kansas_City": {"Golden Ox": "The Golden Ox was a steakhouse restaurant located in the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange building in the West Bottoms area of Kansas City, Missouri. Founded in 1949, the Golden Ox was the birthplace of the Kansas City strip steak. The Golden Ox was often regarded as the oldest steakhouse in Kansas City, because while Jess & Jim's Steakhouse opened more than a decade earlier in 1938, the Martin City area where Jess & Jim's is located was not annexed by Kansas City until 1963."}}
