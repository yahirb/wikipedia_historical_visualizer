{"Santa_Rosa": {"Taylor Mountain (Sonoma County, California)": "Taylor Mountain is a summit at the northern extreme of the Sonoma Mountains in California. The mountain lies in the Laguna de Santa Rosa drainage basin; its east flank drains to Matanzas Creek, a northwestward flowing stream running the length of Bennett Valley, and its west flank drains to Five Creek. The mountain is named after California Gold Rush pioneer John Shackleford Taylor, who settled on the mountain slopes in 1853 to raise dairy cows and plant a vineyard.\nNorth of Taylor Mountain, Taylor Ridge descends toward the city of Santa Rosa. Some of Santa Rosa's urban expansion is taking place to the east of this ridge.\nTaylor Mountain is readily visible from Sonoma Mountain, Bennett Valley, the Santa Rosa Plain and from as far north as the Alexander Valley.\nThe peak of Taylor Mountain defines (in part) the boundary between the Sonoma Coast AVA and the Sonoma Valley AVA, two federally designated grape-growing regions. Wines made from grapes grown on its western slopes would qualify for the Sonoma Coast appellation, whereas those made from grapes grown on its eastern slopes would qualify for the Sonoma Valley appellation."}}
