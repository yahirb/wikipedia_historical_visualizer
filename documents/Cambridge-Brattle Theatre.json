{"Cambridge": {"Brattle Theatre": "The Brattle Theatre is a repertory movie theater located at 40 Brattle Street (Brattle Hall) in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States of America. The theatre is a small movie house with one screen. It is one of the few remaining movie theaters, if not the only one, that use a rear-projection system; the projector is located behind the screen rather than behind the audience."}}
