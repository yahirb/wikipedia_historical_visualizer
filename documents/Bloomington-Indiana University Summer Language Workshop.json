{"Bloomington": {"Indiana University Summer Language Workshop": "The Indiana University Summer Language Workshop (also known as SWSEEL) is one of the oldest and largest summer language programs in the United States. Located on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University (IU), the Workshop was founded in 1950 at the height of the Cold War to provide intensive training in Russian and later other less commonly taught foreign languages. For the more than 65 years of its existence, the workshop has provided language training to over ten thousand students."}}
