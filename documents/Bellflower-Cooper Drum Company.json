{"Bellflower": {"Cooper Drum Company": "Cooper Drum Company recycled closed top, steel drums on a 3.8-acre (15,000 m2) facility in South Gate, California from 1976 to 2003. They used strong chemicals to recondition the drums, leading to public concern about health impacts on the surrounding community. In particular, staff and students from Tweedy Elementary School, which borders the Cooper Drum site to the south, complained of health problems that may have resulted from exposure to toxic chemical coming from Cooper Drum Company."}}
