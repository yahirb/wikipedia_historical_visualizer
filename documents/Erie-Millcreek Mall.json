{"Erie": {"Millcreek Mall": "The Millcreek Mall or Millcreek Mall Complex is a one-level shopping center located 3.4 miles (5.5 km) southwest of downtown Erie, Pennsylvania, between Peach Street and Interstate 79, in Millcreek Township.\nThe complex opened in 1975 and was developed by the Youngstown, Ohio-based Cafaro Company, who still own and operate it. Due to Pennsylvania's lack of sales tax on clothing, the Millcreek Mall attracts many visitors from Ohio, New York and Canada."}}
