{"Hillsboro": {"Stephen and Parthena M. Blank House": "The Stephen and Parthena M. Blank House, also known as the Old Stagecoach Stop, is a historic residence located in Forest Grove, Oregon, United States. Built in 1858 or 1859, it is one of Forest Grove's distinctive examples of mid-19th century Greek Revival architecture. Gradual extensions of the structure from the 1850s to the 1880s employed multiple frame construction methods; the house particularly exhibits clear remnants of the balloon-frame and box-frame techniques of the period."}}
