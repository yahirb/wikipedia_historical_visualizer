{"Mobile": {"Africatown": "Africatown, also known as AfricaTown USA and Plateau, is an historic community located three miles (5 km) north of downtown Mobile, Alabama. It was formed by a group of 32 West Africans, who in 1860, were among the last known illegal shipment of 110 slaves to the United States from the Kingdom of Dahomey on the Clotilda, after the Atlantic slave trade had been banned since 1808. More than 30 of these people, believed to be ethnic Yoruba and Fon, founded and created their own community in this area."}}
