{"Bloomington": {"Lake Nokomis": "Lake Nokomis is one of several lakes in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The lake was previously named Lake Amelia in honor of Captain George Gooding's daughter, Amelia, in 1819. Its current name was adopted in 1910 to honor Nokomis, grandmother of Hiawatha (legendary Indian hero of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, The Song of Hiawatha)."}}
