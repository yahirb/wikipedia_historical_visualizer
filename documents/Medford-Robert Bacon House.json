{"Medford": {"Robert Bacon House": "The Robert Bacon House is a historic house at 6 Mystic Valley Parkway in Winchester, Massachusetts. Built about 1830, it is one of the town's only surviving examples of high-style transitional Federal/Greek Revival styling. It was built for a local businessman whose nearby mills (no longer surviving) were major employers of the period."}}
