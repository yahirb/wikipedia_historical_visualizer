{"White_Plains": {"New York School for the Deaf": "The New York School for the Deaf is a private school for the deaf in White Plains, New York, just north of New York City, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe New York School for the Deaf was chartered in 1817 as the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, and opened its first classes in New York City in 1818 just after the American School for the Deaf, and thus is recognized as the second oldest deaf school in the United States. It moved twice in the 19th century to other Manhattan locations, and finally to White Plains, New York in 1938, where it remains."}}
