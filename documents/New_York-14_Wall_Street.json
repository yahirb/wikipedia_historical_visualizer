{"New_York": {"14 Wall Street": "14 Wall Street, originally the Bankers Trust Company Building, is a skyscraper at 14 Wall Street at the corner of Nassau Street and running through to Pine Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. It sits across Nassau Street from Federal Hall National Memorial, across Wall Street from the New York Stock Exchange and diagonally across from the original headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company. It was built in 1910-12 and was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the neoclassical style as the headquarters for Bankers Trust. An addition with Art Deco detailing, designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, was constructed in 1931-33. The stepped pyramid at the building's top is a noted part of the downtown skyline, and became the logo for Bankers Trust, which sold the building in 1937.\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark on January 14, 1997."}}
