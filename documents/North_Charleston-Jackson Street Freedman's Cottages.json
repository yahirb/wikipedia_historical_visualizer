{"North_Charleston": {"Jackson Street Freedman's Cottages": "The Jackson Street Freedman's Cottages are four small worker housing units at 193-199 Jackson Street in Charleston, South Carolina. They are simple frame structures with gabled roofs and front porches, built in the 1890s to meet demand for worker housing. The stylistic appellation \"freedman's cottage\" is based on the incorrect belief that these types of houses were originally commonly built for recently emancipated African Americans after the American Civil War."}}
