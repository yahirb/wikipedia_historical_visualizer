{"Lowell": {"Wilder Street Historic District": "The Wilder Street Historic District is a historic district at 284-360 Wilder Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The section of Wilder Street between Westford Street and Branch Road contains a remarkable collection of large late 19th-century houses. About one dozen wealthy businessmen built elaborate houses in Queen Anne, Italianate, Stick, and Second Empire styles in this area, which was developed by its landowner, Charles Wilder, and it was considered one of the city's most fashionable addresses of the time."}}
