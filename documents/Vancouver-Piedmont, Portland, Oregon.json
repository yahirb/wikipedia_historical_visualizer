{"Vancouver": {"Piedmont, Portland, Oregon": "Piedmont is a neighborhood in the north and northeast sections of Portland, Oregon. The Piedmont subdivision was platted in 1889 by Edward Quackenbush, and promoted in an early flyer as \"The Emerald, Portland's Evergreen Suburb, Devoted Exclusively to Dwellings, A Place of Homes.\" The original subdivision, now known as \"Historic Piedmont,\" includes parts of the Humboldt and King neighborhoods, as well as the modern Piedmont neighborhood south of Rosa Parks Way.\nIn 1947, after a failed attempt to build a NABISCO factory in the Rose City Park neighborhood, a factory location along Columbia Boulevard was chosen."}}
