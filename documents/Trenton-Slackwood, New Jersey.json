{"Trenton": {"Slackwood, New Jersey": "Slackwood is an unincorporated community located within Lawrence Township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The area is named for the owners of the land that was subdivided into the neighborhood today, Joseph Slack and William Wood. The neighborhood was first developed in 1890 as the first suburban development in the reconfigured Lawrence Township (a portion of the township had seceded in the 1880s to form Millham Township, now part of the City of Trenton)."}}
