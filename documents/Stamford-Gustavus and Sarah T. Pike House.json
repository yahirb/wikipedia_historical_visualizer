{"Stamford": {"Gustavus and Sarah T. Pike House": "The Gustavus and Sarah T. Pike House is a historic house at 164 Fairfield Avenue, in the southwestern section of the city of Stamford, Connecticut is a Queen Anne style house built in 1880. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is architecturally significant as a good example of a Queen Anne style house in Stamford, and also an excellent example of pattern book application. The building follows a pattern book design by H. H. Holly. It includes machine-made spindle and other detailing that only then became cost-effective with then-modern manufacturing."}}
