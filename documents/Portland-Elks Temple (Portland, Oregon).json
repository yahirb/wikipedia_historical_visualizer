{"Portland": {"Elks Temple (Portland, Oregon)": "The Elks Temple, also known as the Princeton Building and as the west wing of the Governor Hotel, is a former Elks building and historic hotel building in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Built in 1923, it is one of two NRHP-listed buildings that make up the Sentinel Hotel, the other being the 1909-built Seward Hotel. The Seward was renamed the Governor Hotel in 1932, and in 1992 it was joined with the former Elks building, and thereafter the building became the west wing of a two-building hotel, an expanded Governor Hotel."}}
