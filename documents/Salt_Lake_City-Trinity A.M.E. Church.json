Church was Utah's first black congregation, started in the 1880s. After years of meeting in homes and rented buildings, and one unsuccessful attempt to build a church, the congregation was able to buy this property in 1907 with money donated by Mary Bright, a cook who had made her fortune in Leadville, Colorado."}}
