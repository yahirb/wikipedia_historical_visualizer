{"Shawnee": {"Argentine Bridge": "The Argentine Bridge was a one lane, thru-truss bridge over the Kansas River in Kansas City, Kansas. It was built in 1908, and removed in 1959, after the 18th Street Expressway Bridge was built to the east of it. It was damaged in the flood of 1951, after being crushed by a large oil tanker that floated from a field near the Kansas Avenue Bridge (West)."}}
