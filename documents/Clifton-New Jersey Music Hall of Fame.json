{"Clifton": {"New Jersey Music Hall of Fame": "The New Jersey Music Hall of Fame was founded in 2005 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, with plans to construct a building in downtown Asbury Park or closer to the Boardwalk. New Jersey has a rich musical heritage, covering artists from Count Basie to Frank Sinatra to Bruce Springsteen. New Jersey has also played a role in the technology behind music; Thomas Edison invented the record player in the state in 1877, while Les Paul created the solid-body guitar."}}
