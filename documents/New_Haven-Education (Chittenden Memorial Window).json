{"New_Haven": {"Education (Chittenden Memorial Window)": "Education is a stained-glass window commissioned from Louis Comfort Tiffany's Tiffany Glass Company during the building of Yale University's Chittenden Hall (now Linsly-Chittenden Hall, after being connected to a nearby building), funded by Simeon Baldwin Chittenden. Personifications of Art, Science, Religion, and Music are represented in the work, as angels. Other angelic representations of related virtues, values, and ideas attend them, each identified by words in their halos."}}
