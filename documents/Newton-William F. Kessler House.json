{"Newton": {"William F. Kessler House": "The William F. Kessler House is a historic house at 211 Highland Street in Newton, Massachusetts. Built in 1913, the 1 1/2 story wood frame house is a fine example of rustic Craftsman styling. The front roof slopes down to form a porch, which is supported by brick and fieldstone piers."}}
