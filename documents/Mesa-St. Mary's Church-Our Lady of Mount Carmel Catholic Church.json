{"Mesa": {"St. Mary's Church-Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church": "Our Lady of Mount Carmel is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in her role as patroness of the Carmelite Order. The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a chapel which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the \"Lady of the place.\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of Chile, in South America."}}
