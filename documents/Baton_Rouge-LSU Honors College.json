The Ogden Honors College primarily admits the top 10% of incoming LSU freshmen, and provides its students with a curriculum of rigorous seminar classes, mentoring relationships with top LSU faculty, and opportunities for undergraduate research, culminating in the Honors Thesis. Its focus on community service, study abroad, internships and independent research helps today\u2019s high-achieving students become tomorrow\u2019s leaders. The Ogden Honors College is led by Dean Dr. Jonathan Earle, who joined the University in 2014. Since 2005, Ogden Honors students have been awarded with more than 100 prestigious national and international fellowships, including 18 Goldwater Scholarships, 10 Truman Scholarships, 36 NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, 17 Critical Language Scholarships, and 4 Udall Scholarships. In December 2014, LSU announced that they had received a $12 million investment from Roger Ogden, notable alumnus and philanthropist, the largest unrestricted endowed gift in LSU history. Shortly after, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved the renaming of the college to be the \"Roger Hadfield Ogden Honors College\" in honor of Ogden's late father and son."}}
