{"Atlanta": {"W233BF": "W233BF FM 94.5, known as Streetz 94-5, is a radio station in metro Atlanta, now licensed to serve Atlanta. After a series of moves (previously serving the eastern exurb of Social Circle), the station now transmits from the tall WUPA TV tower east of downtown, just north of Interstate 20. The station broadcasts a hip hop music format, with a heavy emphasis on local artists, and is less mainstream than other similar stations in the format such as WHTA and WVEE.\nAlthough the station is licensed as a \"broadcast translator\" (a service intended to retransmit analog FM stations to distant or terrain-obstructed areas), it is operating independently under a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) legal fiction that allows such stations to transmit original programming if it is also simulcast on another station's HD Radio digital subchannel \u2014 in this case, 94.1 WSTR's HD3 subchannel."}}
