{"New_York": {"The Sphere": "The Sphere (officially Sphere at Plaza Fountain) is a 25 feet (7.6 m) high, cast bronze sculpture by German artist Fritz Koenig that is located in Liberty Park at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Originally located in the Austin J. Tobin Plaza, it survived the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers as a result of the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nHaving stood centrally in Austin J. Tobin Plaza between the twin towers, The Sphere was recovered from the rubble, visibly damaged but largely intact."}}
