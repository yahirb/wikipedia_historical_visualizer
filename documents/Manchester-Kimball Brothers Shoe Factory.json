{"Manchester": {"Kimball Brothers Shoe Factory": "The Kimball Brothers Shoe Factory is a historic factory building at 335 Cypress Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The four-story brick building was built in stages between 1885 and 1900, and was a prototypical structure from which the design of other period shoe factories in Manchester were built. Construction was overseen by Head & Dowst, a builder responsible for a number of area public buildings, including schools and prisons."}}
