{"New_York": {"Stone Street (Manhattan)": "Stone Street is a short street in Manhattan's Financial District. It originally ran from Broad Street to Hanover Square, but was divided into two sections by the construction of the Goldman Sachs building at 85 Broad Street in the 1980s. Today the cluster of historic buildings along Stone, South William, Pearl Streets and Coenties Alley form the Stone Street Historic District."}}
