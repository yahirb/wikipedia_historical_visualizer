{"Pawtucket": {"Church Hill Industrial District": "The Church Hill Industrial District is an industrial historic district on the west side of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It encompasses an area that was intensively developed between about 1850 and 1920, and includes five separate industrial facilities. Four of these are relatively modest in size (as compared to Pawtucket's largest mills), and originally served a combination of textile mills and ironworks, the latter of which often manufactured parts used in the textile manufacturing processes."}}
