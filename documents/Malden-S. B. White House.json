{"Malden": {"S. B. White House": "The S. B. White House is a historic house at 8 Stevens Street in Winchester, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the early 1850s, and is one of the finest local examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Its exterior is finished in clapboards, and its steeply-pitched gables are decorated with icicle-like vergeboard."}}
