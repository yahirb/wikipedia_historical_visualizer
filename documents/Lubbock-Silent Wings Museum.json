{"Lubbock": {"Silent Wings Museum": "Silent Wings Museum, \"The Legacy of The World War II Glider Pilots\", is a museum in Lubbock, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum is located on the site of World War II South Plains Army Air Field, where glider pilots were trained between 1942 and 1945, after which time they were required also to command skills in powered flight. The Lubbock site was chosen for the glider school because of its dry, warm weather, mostly clear skies, and goodwill in the local community."}}
