{"Wilmington": {"Delaware Memorial Bridge": "The Delaware Memorial Bridge is a twin suspension bridge crossing the Delaware River. The toll bridges carry Interstate 295 and U.S. Route 40 between Delaware and New Jersey. The bridge was designed by the firm known today as HNTB with consulting help from engineer Othmar Ammann, whose other designs include the Walt Whitman Bridge (which is similar in appearance, except for the additional travel lanes and shorter center span) and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge."}}
