{"Worcester": {"Washburn Square\u2013Leicester Common Historic District": "The Washburn Square\u2013Leicester Common Historic District encompasses the historic civic heart of Leicester, Massachusetts. It includes Washburn Square, as the town common is called; the buildings along its perimeter; and the properties along Main Street extending east along Main Street to its junction with Henshaw Street. It includes the 1939 Leicester Town Hall, Becker College's 1962 Swan Library, a Victorian Gothic Revival First Congregational Church (a rarity due to its comparatively late construction date, 1901) and the 1834 Leicester Unitarian Church (originally known as the Second Congregational Church)."}}
