{"Pawtucket": {"Lime Rock, Rhode Island": "Lime Rock (Limerock) is a village and historic district in Lincoln, Providence County, Rhode Island, United States, near Rhode Island Route 146. The village was named after the limestone quarries in the area, which started in the 17th century, and continue to the present where Conklin Limestone Company now operates. Because of the abundance of limestone in the area many houses had massive end chimneys and were called \"stone enders,\" a distinctly Rhode Island style of architecture."}}
