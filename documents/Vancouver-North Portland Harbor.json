{"Vancouver": {"North Portland Harbor": "The North Portland Harbor is an Oregon waterway or channel in Multnomah County, specifically in Portland. An anabranch, about 5 miles (8 km) long, of the Columbia River, it separates Hayden and Tomahawk islands from the mainland. Flowing generally northwest, the channel rejoins the main stem slightly upstream of Kelley Point Park and the mouth of the Willamette River."}}
