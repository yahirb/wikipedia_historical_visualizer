{"Roanoke": {"Belle Aire": "Belle Aire is a Greek Revival mansion listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register in the Greater Deyerle neighborhood of the independent city of Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.A. Located just south of Brandon Avenue SW (U.S. 11) at 3820 Belle Aire Circle SW, Belle Aire was completed in 1849 as the private residence of Madison and Margeret Pitzer on a knoll overlooking their 1,600 acres (2.500 sq mi; 6.475 km2) of land adjacent to the Roanoke River. It is located approximately one-half mile from his brother Jeramiah's house (Mount Airy). Today the home still stands, with the surrounding area now developed as single family home typical of those built during the 1970s-80s."}}
