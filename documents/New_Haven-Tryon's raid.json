{"New_Haven": {"Tryon's raid": "In July 1779, British Major General William Tryon and 2600 men embarked onto a Royal Navy fleet led by Admiral George Collier, and raided the Connecticut ports of New Haven, Fairfield and Norwalk. Military and public stores, supply houses, and ships were destroyed, as were private homes, churches and other public buildings. The raids were ineffectually resisted by militia forces."}}
