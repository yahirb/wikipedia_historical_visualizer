It is located on the west side of Willett Avenue (Rhode Island Route 103), on Florence Street, Princeton and Dartmouth Avenues, and Roseland Court. The 7-acre (2.8 ha) district includes 38 residential buildings, and was mostly built between 1928 and 1939 as a streetcar suburb of Providence by Severin Carlson and Carl Johnson."}}
