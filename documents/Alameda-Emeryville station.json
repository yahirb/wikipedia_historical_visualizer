{"Alameda": {"Emeryville station": "Emeryville is an Amtrak station in Emeryville, Alameda County, California that replaced the older Amtrak 16th Street Station in Oakland. The original Beaux-Arts Oakland 16th Street Station was declared unsafe due to unreinforced masonry after sustaining damage in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. Emeryville opened on August 13, 1993, although service continued at Oakland for another year."}}
