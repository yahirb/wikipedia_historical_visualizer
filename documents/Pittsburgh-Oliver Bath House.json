{"Pittsburgh": {"Oliver Bath House": "The Oliver Bath House is an indoor swimming pool owned and run by the Aquatic Division of the City of Pittsburgh. The Oliver Bath House was built at the base of the South Tenth Street Bridge on the corner of Bingham Street in 1910, and donated to the city of Pittsburgh in 1915 when Henry W. Oliver gave the city $100,000 to construct a South Side Public Bath House, decreeing that it be \"free for the use of the people forever.\" He also gave $100,000 as an endowment to cover maintenance and employee salaries, leaving utilities as the city's only financial responsibility. This became so as in the early 1900s the phrase, \"The Great Unwashed\" was applied to the gritty mill workers and anyone in the social order who had not yet achieved social graces and indoor plumbing."}}
