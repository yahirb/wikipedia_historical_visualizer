{"Hoboken": {"Gay Street (Manhattan)": "Gay Street is a short, crooked street that marks off one block of Greenwich Village in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The street's name does not refer to the LGBT character of Greenwich Village, or to any other LGBT issues for that matter. The name may come from a family named Gay who owned land or lived there in colonial times: a newspaper of May 11, 1775 contains a classified ad where an \"R. Gay\", living in the Bowery, offers a gelding for sale."}}
