{"Alexandria": {"Hollin Hills": "Hollin Hills is a neighborhood in Hybla Valley, Virginia, though much of the neighborhood (east of Elba Road and Rebecca Drive) was transferred to the Fort Hunt CDP for census purposes prior to 2010. It has about 450 houses conceived and built by builder Robert C. Davenport, and designed by D.C.-based architect Charles M. Goodman (who also designed the Washington National Airport) and landscape architect Dan Kiley.\nHollin Hills is next to other neighborhoods such as Villamay and Mason Hill, just south of Alexandria in the South Alexandria section of Fairfax County, Virginia."}}
