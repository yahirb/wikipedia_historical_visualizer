{"Renton": {"Coal Creek (Washington)": "Coal Creek is a creek in Bellevue, Washington, USA, on Seattle's Eastside. It is named for the coal mining industry prominent in the area in the 19th century. There is a popular trail which parallels the creek, allowing views of defunct coal mining equipment and even some bits of coal sitting on the ground in spots."}}
