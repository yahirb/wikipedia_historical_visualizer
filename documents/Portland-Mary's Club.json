{"Portland": {"Mary's Club": "Mary's Club is the oldest strip club in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. In 1954 Roy Keller bought the business from Mary Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s. Keller initially hired go-go dancers as entertainment during the piano player's breaks, later hiring them full-time because of their popularity."}}
