{"Kissimmee": {"Monument of States": "The Monument of States was conceived as a symbol of American unity after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is located at 300 E. Monument Avenue in Kissimmee, Florida. It was built by volunteers, with donations of stone that came from around the world, including a rock from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was the brainchild of Charles W. Bressler-Pettis, who also hoped it would become a unique tourist attraction for the city."}}
