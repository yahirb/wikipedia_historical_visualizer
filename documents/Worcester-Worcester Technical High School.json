{"Worcester": {"Worcester Technical High School": "Worcester Technical High School (WTHS) is a vocational-technical high school, part of Worcester Public Schools district in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. It opened on August 28, 2006, replacing the old Worcester Vocational High School (formerly known as Worcester Boys' Trade High School from 1909 to about 1975) at 2 Grove Street. The school was also known for a period as Worcester Vocational Technical High School (WVTHS) beginning around 1975. When the David Hale Fanning Trade School (commonly called \"Girls' Trade\" or DHFTS) in Worcester closed its Chatham Street premises some years later, the curriculum, staff and student body transferred to WVTHS. Since many new non-technical areas of study were added by the merging of the two schools, the word \"Technical\" was dropped from the school's name."}}
