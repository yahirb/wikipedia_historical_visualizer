{"Newark": {"NX Bridge": "The NX Draw (sometimes colloquially known the \"Annie Bridge\") is an out-of-service railroad bridge on the Passaic River between Newark and Kearny, New Jersey. It is the 13th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is 6.5 miles (10.5 km) upstream from it. The bascule bridge (sometimes called a jackknife bridge), built by the Erie Railroad and once part of its Newark Branch, has been abandoned in the raised position."}}
