{"Simi_Valley": {"Santa Susana High School": "Santa Susana High School is one of four public high schools located in the Simi Valley Unified School District in Simi Valley, California. Built in 1970, the school campus was originally designed as a junior high campus formerly known as Sequoia Junior High School. In June 1995, the Simi Valley School Board voted one junior high campus be converted into a magnet high school to accommodate the move of 9th graders into regular high school campuses, and all remaining junior high campuses be converted into middle schools."}}
