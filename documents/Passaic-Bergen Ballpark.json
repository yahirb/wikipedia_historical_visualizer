{"Passaic": {"Bergen Ballpark": "The Bergen Ballpark was a proposed 8,000-seat baseball-only stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, intended to be the home of the Bergen Cliff Hawks. The stadium was to be part of the larger Meadowlands Xanadu project that is currently under construction. Bergen Ballpark was in the planning stages since 2001, but local politics and a lease agreement between the Mills Corporation, the company who built the Xanadu and would own the ballpark, halted plans in 2005."}}
