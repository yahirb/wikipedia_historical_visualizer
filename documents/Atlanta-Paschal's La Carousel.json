{"Atlanta": {"Paschal's La Carousel": "Paschal's La Carousel was a jazz club in Atlanta, Georgia. Opened in 1960, it became known as Atlanta's \"jazz mecca\" as it featured top-name artists such as Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gillespie, Gladys Knight, and Jimmy Smith. It was the only nightclub in Atlanta open to blacks in the then-segregated city."}}
