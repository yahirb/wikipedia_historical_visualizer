{"New_Haven": {"Amity Regional High School": "Amity High School is a regional public high school located in Woodbridge, Connecticut, USA. It provides high school education (grades 9-12) for the children in the towns of Woodbridge, Orange, and Bethany (which together form Regional District #5 for the purpose of secondary education). The name Amity is derived from both the colonial history of Woodbridge as well as the \"friendship\" demonstrated among the three founding towns in arranging for a communal educational program.\nAmity High School was named a Blue Ribbon School by the US Department of Education in 1982, the first year of the program, and was recognized with the same distinction again in 2014."}}
