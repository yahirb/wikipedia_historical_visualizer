{"Burbank": {"Capitol Studios": "Established in 1956, Capitol Studios are located in the landmark Capitol Records Tower in the heart of Hollywood, California. The legendary recording studios, which consist of Studios A, B, C and D, started as the primary recording studios for American record label Capitol Records. While they are still regularly used by Capitol recording artists, during the late 1960s to early-1970s the studios began making the facility available to artists outside the label."}}
