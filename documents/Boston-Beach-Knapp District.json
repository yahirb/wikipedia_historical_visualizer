{"Boston": {"Beach-Knapp District": "The Beach-Knapp District encompasses a collection of six 19th-century buildings in the Chinatown neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is centered at the corner of Beach and Knapp Streets, and includes three buildings on the south side of Beach Street, and three on the east side of Knapp. The buildings encapsulate the transition of the area from a predominantly residential area to a mixed residential-light industrial area in the 19th century."}}
