{"New_Brunswick": {"Road Up Raritan Historic District": "The Road Up Raritan Historic District is located along River Road in Piscataway, Middlesex County, New Jersey. It is north of Raritan Landing, once an important inland port on the Raritan River during the 18th and 19th centuries. The name is taken from an earlier colonial era name for what was once a Lenape path, Assunpink Trail that became a main road parallel to the river."}}
