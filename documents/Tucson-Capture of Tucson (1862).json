{"Tucson": {"Capture of Tucson (1862)": "Union forces entered Tucson on May 20, 1862, with a force of 2,000 men without firing a shot.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJust prior to the American Civil War in the late 1850s, the cities of Tucson and Mesilla in southern New Mexico Territory petitioned the United States government to create a separate Territory of Arizona. The proposal was defeated after representatives from the Northern \"free\" states and the Southern \"slave\" states could not agree on how to divide New Mexico Territory."}}
