{"Pittsburgh": {"West End Bridge (Pittsburgh)": "The West End Bridge is a steel bowstring arch bridge over the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, approximately one mile below the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. The bridge was built from 1930 to 1932 primarily by the American Bridge Company (superstructure) and the Foundation Company (substructure) and was the world's first to use tied-arch technology on a large scale. It connects the West End to the Chateau neighborhood on the North Side of Pittsburgh."}}
