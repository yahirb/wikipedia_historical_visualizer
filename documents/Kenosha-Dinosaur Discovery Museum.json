{"Kenosha": {"Dinosaur Discovery Museum": "The Dinosaur Discovery Museum in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States, is dedicated to the exploration and explication of the relationship between modern birds and ancient carnivorous biped dinosaurs, the theropods, which include Carnotaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex, and Velociraptor. This link is especially well documented in the fossil record. The museum has the largest skeletal cast collection of Theropods (meat-eating) dinosaurs in North America and is the only museum to focus a gallery specifically on the evolution of birds from non-avian dinosaurs."}}
