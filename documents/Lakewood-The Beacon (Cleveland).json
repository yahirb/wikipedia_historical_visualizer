{"Lakewood": {"The Beacon (Cleveland)": "The Beacon is a skyscraper in downtown Cleveland that began construction at 515 Euclid Avenue in late 2017. The tower will be 355 feet (108 m) tall, with approval from the city council to exceed the city's 250 feet (76 m) limit. The building will be located on the GCRTA Euclid Corridor Rapid Bus Transit line that leads from Public Square to the University Circle district on the south east side of the city\nPart of the need for the tower is due to the two decade old resurgence of interest in downtown Cleveland."}}
