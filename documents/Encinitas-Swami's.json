{"Encinitas": {"Swami's": "Swami's is an area in San Diego County that contains Swami's Beach and other local attractions. The beach, also known as \"Swami\u2019s Reef'\" and \"Swamis\", is an internationally known surfing spot, a point break located in Encinitas, San Diego County, California. Swami's was named after Swami Paramahansa Yogananda, because the grounds and hermitage of the Self-Realization Fellowship ashram, built in 1937, overlook this reef point."}}
