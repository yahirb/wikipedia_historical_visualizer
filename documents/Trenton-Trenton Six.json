{"Trenton": {"Trenton Six": "The Trenton Six is the group name for six African-American defendants tried for murder of an elderly white shopkeeper in January 1948 in Trenton, New Jersey. The six young men were convicted in August 1948 by an all-white jury of the murder and sentenced to death.\nTheir case was taken up as a major civil rights case, because of injustices after their arrests and questions about the trial."}}
