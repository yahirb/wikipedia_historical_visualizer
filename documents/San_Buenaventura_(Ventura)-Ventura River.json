{"San_Buenaventura_(Ventura)": {"Ventura River": "The Ventura River, located in western Ventura County in southern California, United States, flows 16.2 miles (26.1 km) from its headwaters through to the Pacific Ocean. The smallest of the three major rivers in Ventura County, the Ventura River's source stream is Matilija Creek, from its confluence with North Fork Matilija Creek. Matilija Creek is Ventura River's highest volume tributary, followed by San Antonio Creek, which joins the Ventura River from the east halfway to the ocean; Coyote Creek enters the river from the west about 7 miles (11 km) from the river mouth and Ca\u00f1ada Larga Creek from the east a few miles downstream."}}
