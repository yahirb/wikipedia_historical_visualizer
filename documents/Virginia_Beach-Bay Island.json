{"Virginia_Beach": {"Bay Island": "Bay Island is a two mile long island situated in the North Great Neck area of Virginia Beach, Virginia. The island is bordered by Long Creek to the north and Broad Bay to the south, both offshoots of the Lynnhaven River, and is connected to the mainland by the West Great Neck Bridge on the western side of the island. The island traditionally contains two residential neighborhoods: Broad Bay Colony on the western side of the island and Bay Island on the eastern side, although most residents just refer to the entire residential area as Bay Island."}}
