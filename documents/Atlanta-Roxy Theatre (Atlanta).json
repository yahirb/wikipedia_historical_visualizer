{"Atlanta": {"Roxy Theatre (Atlanta)": "The Roxy Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia was one of the great movie palaces of the city. It was notable for showcasing the original Atlanta runs of such films as Spartacus, the 1962 The Music Man, the Technicolor Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, [1], and My Fair Lady. It was torn down in 1972 to make way for the Westin Peachtree Plaza, the hotel that was prominently featured in the 1981 film Sharky's Machine."}}
