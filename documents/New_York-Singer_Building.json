{"New_York": {"Singer Building": "The Singer Building or Singer Tower, at Liberty Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan's Financial District, in the U.S. state of New York, was a 47-story office building completed in 1908 as the headquarters of the Singer Manufacturing Company. It was the tallest building in the world from 1908 to 1909. It was torn down in 1968, together with the adjacent City Investing Building, and is now the site of One Liberty Plaza. When it was razed, it became the tallest building ever to be demolished, and is currently the third-tallest building ever to be destroyed (after the World Trade Center towers) and the tallest to be purposely demolished by its owner."}}
