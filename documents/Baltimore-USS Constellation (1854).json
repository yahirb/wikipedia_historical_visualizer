{"Baltimore": {"USS Constellation (1854)": "USS Constellation is a sloop-of-war, the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy. She was built in 1854, using a small amount of material salvaged from the frigate USS Constellation, which had been disassembled the year before. Despite being a single-gundeck \"sloop,\" she is actually larger than her original frigate build, and more powerfully armed with fewer but much more potent shell-firing guns."}}
