{"San_Leandro": {"San Leandro High School": "San Leandro High School is a four-year public high school in San Leandro, California, USA. The school is a member of the San Leandro Unified School District. In 2007, the School District bought land for a new building to house the freshman class to relieve overcrowding at SLHS. This move has met with some opposition due to the separation of the freshman class from the rest of the school. The freshman (9th grade) campus is named the \"Fred Korematsu Campus\", after Japanese American activist Fred Korematsu."}}
