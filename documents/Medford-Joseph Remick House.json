{"Medford": {"Joseph Remick House": "The Joseph Remick House is a historic house at 84 Cambridge Street and 4 Swan Road in Winchester, Massachusetts. The two story stucco-clad house was built in 1909 by Joseph Remick, and is sometimes called the \"Baby Sanborn House\" for its resemblance to the much larger Sanborn House just down the road. The house has a central five-bay section, which is flanked by wings that are one story in front and two in back."}}
