{"Cincinnati": {"James A. Ramage Civil War Museum": "The James A. Ramage Civil War Museum seeks to tell the untold story of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky's involvement in the American Civil War. Although there were no major battles set there, the people of the area resisted a strong push by the Confederate army in 1862. This museum is set on one of the key locations of that stronghold - Battery Hooper."}}
