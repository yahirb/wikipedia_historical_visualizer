{"Minneapolis": {"Midway Stadium": "Midway Stadium is the name of two different minor league baseball parks in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, both now demolished. The name derived from the location of the stadium in St. Paul's Midway area, so named because it's roughly halfway between the downtowns of Minneapolis and Saint Paul."}}
