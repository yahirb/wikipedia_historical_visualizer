{"Newton": {"Kingsbury House": "The Kingsbury House is a historic house at 137 Suffolk Street in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. The oldest part of this 2 1/2 story timber frame may have been built as early as 1686; its exterior styling suggests a construction date in the early 18th century, but the earlier structure may have been incorporated in new construction at that time. The house is one a few First Period houses in Newton, and was associated for many years in the 19th century with the Kingsbury family, who were major landowners in the Chestnut Hill area."}}
