{"Rochester": {"Can of Worms (interchange)": "The Can of Worms is the local name for the intersection of Interstate 490 (I-490), I-590, New York State Route 590 (NY 590), NY 96 (East Avenue), and University Avenue on the east side of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The junction was built during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Rochester Outer Loop's construction, and rebuilt in the late 1980s to eliminate weaving caused by the interchange's original design. Although the reconstruction eliminated many of the issues, the Can of Worms name stuck and is still used locally."}}
