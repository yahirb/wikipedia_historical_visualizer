{"Centennial": {"Rachel Scott": "Rachel Joy Scott (August 5, 1981 \u2013 April 20, 1999) was an American student and the first murder victim of the Columbine High School massacre, in which 11 other students and a teacher were also murdered before both perpetrators committed suicide.\nShe has since been the subject of several books and is the inspiration for Rachel's Challenge, an international school outreach program and the most popular school assembly program in America. Its aim is to advocate Scott's belief, based on her life, her journals, and the contents of a two-page essay penned just a month before her murder entitled My Ethics; My Codes of Life which advocates her belief in compassion being \"the greatest form of love humans have to offer\"."}}
