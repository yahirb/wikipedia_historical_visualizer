{"Baton_Rouge": {"Tiger Park (1997)": "The original Tiger Park was a softball stadium located on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It served as the home field of the LSU Tigers softball team from 1997-2008. The official capacity of the stadium was 1,000 people, however, the stadium held more than that when important rivals came to town or during post-season tournaments. The largest crowd to see a game in the original Tiger Park was on April 28, 2007 when LSU hosted Tennessee before a crowd of 2,326.\nThe stadium was opened prior to the 1997 college softball season and played host to four NCAA Regionals in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2006 and hosted the 2008 SEC Softball Tournament. The 2008 season was the twelfth and final season in the original Tiger Park.
