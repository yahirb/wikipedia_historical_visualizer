{"Hoboken": {"Charlton\u2013King\u2013Vandam Historic District": "The Charlton\u2013King\u2013Vandam Historic District is a small historic district located in the South Village area of the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYCLPC) in 1966, the district contains \"the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses.\"\nThe district includes parts, but not all, of Charlton, King and Vandam Streets between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Varick Street (the southern extension of Seventh Avenue), as well as the block bounded by King, MacDougal and Houston Streets and Sixth Avenue. In its designation report, the NYCLPC emphasized that this area was not a modern creation, but had \"always been, since its beginning, a distinct and separate neighborhood.\"\nIn 1973, the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places."}}
