{"El_Cajon": {"Museum of Creation and Earth History": "The Museum of Creation and Earth History is a young earth creationist promotional facility opened by the Institute for Creation Research at its original headquarters in Santee, California in 1992, replacing an earlier museum located in the Institute's basement. It cost $50,000, and took 2 years to complete.\nAfter the Institute for Creation Research moved from Santee to Dallas, Texas in 2008, it sold the Museum to the Life and Light Foundation, a non-profit ministry run by Tom Cantor."}}
