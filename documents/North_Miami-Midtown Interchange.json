{"North_Miami": {"Midtown Interchange": "The Midtown Interchange, located in the Civic Center and Overtown neighborhoods of Miami, Florida, USA, is the convergence of three major motorways: I-95, I-395 (which connects to the MacArthur Causeway to the east), and the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836).\nSince its opening in 1968, eight lanes have been added to I-95 and an undersea tunnel below Biscayne Bay has been added from the end of I-395 near Bicentennial Park. The tunnel serves as a direct freeway connection to the Port of Miami, expected to alleviate freight traffic in Downtown Miami."}}
