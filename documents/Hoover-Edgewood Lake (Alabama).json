{"Hoover": {"Edgewood Lake (Alabama)": "Edgewood Lake was located in Homewood, Alabama, from 1913 until the 1940s when the lake was drained. The lake was formed by damming Shades Creek near Green Springs Highway. Developed as part of the town of Edgewood, the 117-acre (47 ha) lake was the center of a planned auto racing track that was never completed."}}
