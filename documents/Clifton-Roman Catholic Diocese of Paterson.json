The city of Paterson, third-largest in the state of New Jersey, was chosen as the episcopal see, even though the vast majority of diocesan territory lies west of the city. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Newark, and is part of Region III of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops."}}
