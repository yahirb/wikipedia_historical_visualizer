{"Rochester": {"Genesee Junction, New York": "In the early days of Rochester railroading, Genesee Junction was the name given to the interchange between the West Shore Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad in Chili, NY. However, after the PRR shut down its Rochester Branch following its merger with the New York Central, the name \"Genesee Junction\" moved west to the neighboring interchange between the West Shore (Penn Central by this point) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This interchange, formerly known as West Shore Junction, has retained the name Genesee Junction to this day.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGenesee Junction, despite its status as a hamlet, has no roads or buildings save for those found in the Genesee Junction Yard."}}
