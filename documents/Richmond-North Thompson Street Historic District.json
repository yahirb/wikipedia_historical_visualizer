{"Richmond": {"North Thompson Street Historic District": "The North Thompson Street Historic District encompasses a collection of six International Style commercial buildings on North Thompson Street, between Monument Avenue and Broad Street. All are built of steel, brick, and concrete, and feature expanses of glass and asymmetrical plans. They were built in between 1955 and 1959, as part of a buffer zone of \"quiet commerce\" between the Beltline Expressway on one side and the residential area on the other."}}
