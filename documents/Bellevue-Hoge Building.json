{"Bellevue": {"Hoge Building": "The Hoge Building is a 17-story building constructed in 1911 by, and named for James D. Hoge, a banker and real estate investor, on the northwest corner of Second Avenue and Cherry Street in Seattle, Washington. The building was constructed primarily of tan brick and terracotta built over a steel frame in the architectural style of Second Renaissance Revival with elements of Beaux Arts. During its construction, it was briefly the tallest structure in the state of Washington, until the completion of Tacoma's Key Bank Center later in 1911, and the tallest in Seattle until 1914 with the completion of Smith Tower."}}
