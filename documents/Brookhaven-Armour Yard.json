{"Brookhaven": {"Armour Yard": "Armour Yard is a railyard on the northwest side of Interstate 85 between the Piedmont Road (Georgia State Route 237) and Monroe Drive exits in northeast Atlanta, Georgia, south of the Lindbergh neighborhood of Buckhead. For southbound travelers, it can be easily seen below from the freeway viaduct, and looking underneath the massive viaduct from \"old 85\" (Georgia 13, the Buford-Spring Connector).\nIn 1900 a Belt Junction station is mentioned, which would later be renamed Armour Station."}}
