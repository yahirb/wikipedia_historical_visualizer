{"Phoenix": {"Patriots Square Park": "Patriots Square Park was an urban park located in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. The space has been redeveloped as part of the larger CityScape office and retail project; large portions of the park were demolished as of the spring of 2009. Before the CityScape project broke ground in the fall of 2007, Patriots Square Park was a 2.5 acre (1 hectare) mixed-use park containing open space, an outdoor performing arts stage, and food concessions. The park also served as a decorative cover for a public parking structure located underground which still remains and is in use.\nPatriots Square Park was the location of a number of community celebrations such as the Arizona Asian Festival and Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The park is also listed as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride. It was originally constructed in 1976 and named in honor of the fighters of the American Revolutionary War, and redesigned in 1988 by Alexander and Associates, including the parking structure. In the years between then and the CityScape project, the space fell into slight disrepair and was frequented by transients.\n\n"}}
