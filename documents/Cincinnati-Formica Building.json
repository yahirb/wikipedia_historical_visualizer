{"Cincinnati": {"Formica Building": "The Formica Building is a mixed-use building in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building opened in 1970 and was designed by Chicago architect Harry Weese, perhaps best known for designing the Metro stations in Washington, D.C. The building contains both an office tower and arcade connecting Fourth Street with Fifth Street as well as providing access to the Cincinnati's Skywalk. The building originally contained the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) and at the time, was the largest exhibition venue devoted to contemporary art in the United States."}}
