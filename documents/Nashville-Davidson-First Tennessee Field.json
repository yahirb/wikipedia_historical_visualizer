{"Nashville-Davidson": {"First Tennessee Field": "First Tennessee Field was a proposed minor league baseball stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. The new ballpark was to be built on the banks of the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville on the former site of the Nashville Thermal Transfer Plant. It would have been home to the Nashville Sounds, a Triple-A baseball team of the Pacific Coast League, replacing Herschel Greer Stadium."}}
