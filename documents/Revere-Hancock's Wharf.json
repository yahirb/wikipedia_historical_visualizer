{"Revere": {"Hancock's Wharf": "Hancock's Wharf was a dock on the waterfront of Boston, Massachusetts in the 1700s, owned by John Hancock, and previously his uncle, Thomas Hancock. Hancock's Wharf began from near the foot of Fleet Street and the junction of Fish and Ship Streets. Both of the latter streets are now roughly the present-day Commercial Street."}}
