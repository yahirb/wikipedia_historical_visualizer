{"Daly_City": {"Diamond Heights, San Francisco": "Diamond Heights is a neighborhood in central San Francisco, California, roughly bordered by Diamond Heights Boulevard and Noe Valley to the north and east and Glen Canyon Park to the south and west.\n\n\n== History ==\nDiamond Heights was the first project of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, intended to use its redevelopment powers for land on the hills in the center of the city to be developed with, rather than against, the topography. Few existing residents needed to be relocated for the redevelopment program, which included housing for a range of incomes, churches, schools, parks, and a commercial center."}}
