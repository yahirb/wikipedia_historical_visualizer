{"Cincinnati": {"Cincinnati Skywalk": "The Cincinnati Skywalk is a series of walkways, primarily indoors and elevated, which allows pedestrians to traverse downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.\nBuilt in segments starting in 1971, the 1.3-mile (2.1 km) skywalk was completed in 1997 at a total cost of more than $16 million. Since then, some city leaders have begun to see the skywalk as a barrier to economic development, as it may decrease street-level and sidewalk pedestrian traffic."}}
