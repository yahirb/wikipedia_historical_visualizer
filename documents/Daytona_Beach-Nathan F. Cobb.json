{"Daytona_Beach": {"Nathan F. Cobb": "The Nathan F. Cobb was a three-masted schooner named after the shipbuilder and founder of Cobb\u2019s Salvaging Company whose many rescues of stranded ships help lead to the formation of the United States Life-Saving Service. Despite its namesake's history of shipwreck rescues, the Nathan F. Cobb capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties. The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas."}}
