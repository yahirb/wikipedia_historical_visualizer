{"Boulder": {"Niwot Ridge": "Niwot Ridge is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve located 65 km north-west of Denver in north-central Colorado. Habitats include western spruce-fir forest, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) subalpine forest, alpine meadows as well as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) shrubland. The site is little influenced by human impact and is thus an excellent site to monitor biological, chemical, and physical responses to changes in atmospheric chemistry and climate."}}
