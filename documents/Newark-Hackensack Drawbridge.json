{"Newark": {"Hackensack Drawbridge": "The Hackensack Drawbridge (also known as the HD Draw) was a double-track railroad movable bridge across the mouth of the Hackensack River between Jersey City and Kearny, New Jersey. It was operational until 1946, when a steamship crashed into it.\nBuilt and maintained by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), the bridge was part of the Newark and New York Railroad, a rail line characterized as the \"costliest railroad\" by W. H. Schmidt Jr., a columnist for Trains."}}
