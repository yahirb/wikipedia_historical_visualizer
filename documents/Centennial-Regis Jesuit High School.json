{"Centennial": {"Regis Jesuit High School": "Regis Jesuit High School is a Catholic, college preparatory high school located in Aurora, Colorado, and administered by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Founded in 1877, the high school shares much of its history with its counterpart Regis University in neighboring Denver, Colorado.\nRegis is the Jesuits' only co-institutional high school in the U.S.A. (as opposed to co-educational), meaning that the school is split into two single-gender divisions."}}
