{"New_York": {"Clocktower Productions": "Clocktower Productions is a non-profit art institution working in the visual arts, performance, music, and radio. It was founded in 1972 as The Clocktower Gallery by Alanna Heiss, the Founder and former Director of MoMA PS1 (formerly P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) under the aegis of the Institute for Art and Urban Resources. From 1972 until 2013, the institution operated out of a City-owned McKim, Mead & White building in Lower Manhattan, the former New York Life Insurance Company Building.\nIn 2013, the City of New York sold the building to a private developer, and the organization relocated its operations through program partnerships with other arts institutions around the city, including Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Knockdown Center in Queens, and Times Square Arts, among others."}}
