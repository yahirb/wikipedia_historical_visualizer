{"Newport_News": {"Lunar Landing Research Facility": "The Lunar Landing Research Facility was an area at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia that was used to simulate Apollo Moon landings with a mock Lunar Module powered by a small rocket motor suspended from a crane over a simulated lunar landscape.\nCompleted in 1965 at a cost of $3.5 million, the facility was used by 24 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, to practice solving piloting problems they would encounter in the last 150 feet of descent to the surface of the Moon.\nThe structure was used to facilitate \"flying\" a full-scale Lunar Excursion Module Simulator (LEMS)."}}
