{"Chicopee": {"McIntosh Building": "The McIntosh Building is a historic commercial building at the corner of Chestnut and Worthington Streets in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. It was built in 1918 for the McIntosh Shoe Corporation as it expanded its business. McIntosh was described in 1913 as \"not only the oldest but largest inland boot and shoe jobbing house in [New England].\" The building is a locally unusual example of the Chicago style of architecture."}}
