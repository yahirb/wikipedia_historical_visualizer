{"Schenectady": {"Nott Memorial": "The Nott Memorial is an elaborate 16-sided stone-masonry building which serves as both architectural and physical centerpiece of Union College in Schenectady, New York. Dedicated to Eliphalet Nott, president of Union for a remarkable sixty-two years (1804\u20131866), the 110-foot (34 m) high by 89-foot (27 m) wide structure is a National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nOfficially designated Nott Memorial Hall but referred to by generations of students and faculty simply as \"The Nott\" or \"The Nipple\" (sometimes \"The Nipple of Knowledge\"), the building's centrality and initial design trace back to Josef Ramee's 1813 conception of the school grounds, the first planned college campus in the United States."}}
