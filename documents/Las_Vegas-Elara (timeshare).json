{"Las_Vegas": {"Elara (timeshare)": "Elara (formerly PH Towers) is a 52-story hotel and timeshare building at 80 East Harmon Avenue in Paradise, Nevada, located behind the Planet Hollywood resort that operates on the Las Vegas Strip.\nAfter two projects failed to materialize on the property, Robert Earl and David A. Siegel partnered in 2005 to develop a hotel and timeshare project known as PH Towers. Groundbreaking took place in January 2006, and the tower was topped off in July 2008."}}
