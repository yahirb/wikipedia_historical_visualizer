{"Lincoln": {"State Arsenal (Lincoln, Nebraska)": "The State Arsenal, built in 1913, was the first permanent facility provided by the Nebraska Legislature for support of the Nebraska National Guard, successor to the Nebraska Volunteer Militia. The two-story, rectangular, concrete and brick building with a basement was used by the guard as a warehouse until 1963, when it was transferred to the state fair board. On January 1, 2010, the state fair board transferred ownership of the arsenal building and the surrounding property to the University of Nebraska.\nThe building, located in Lincoln, currently serves as a museum for the Nebraska National Guard."}}
