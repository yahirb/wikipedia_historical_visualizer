It was the third \"union station\" or \"union depot\" (usage varied in the 19th century), succeeding the 1853 station, burned in mid-November 1864 when Federal forces left Atlanta for the March to the Sea, and the 1871 station.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe station was located over the tracks between Forsyth and Spring Streets, 3 blocks west and 1 block south of the predecessor union stations."}}
