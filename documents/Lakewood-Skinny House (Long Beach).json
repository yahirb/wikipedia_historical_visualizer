{"Lakewood": {"Skinny House (Long Beach)": "The aptly nicknamed Skinny House at 708 Gladys Avenue (corner of 7th Street) in the Rose Park neighborhood of Long Beach, California, United States, is a narrow three-story house that has been cited by both the Guinness Book of World Records and Ripley's Believe It or Not as the nation's skinniest house.\nThe yellow-stuccoed house was built on a lot measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) by 50 feet (15 m) in 1932 by Newton P. Rummonds, who received the land as a repayment for a $100 loan one year earlier. He built the 860-square-foot (80 m2) house after someone bet him that he could not build a habitable house on such a small lot."}}
