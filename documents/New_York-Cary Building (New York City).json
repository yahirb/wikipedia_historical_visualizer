{"New_York": {"Cary Building (New York City)": "The Cary Building at 105-107 Chambers Street, extending along Church Street to Reade Street, in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1856-1857 and was designed by Gamaliel King and John Kellum (\"King & Kellum\") in the Italian Renaissance revival style, with the cast-iron facade provided by Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Work. The five-story twin-facaded building was constructed for William H. Cary's Cary, Howard & Sanger, a dry goods firm.\nAlthough built as a commercial structure, the Cary Building is now residential. As a result of the widening of Church Street in the 1920s, a 200-foot-long wall of unadorned brick is now exposed on the east side of the building; as Christopher Gray observed in the New York Times, comparing the structure to cast-iron buildings with facades obscured by modern signage, \"There is not too little of the Cary Building but too much.\"\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark in 1982, and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The building was once home to The New York Sun."}}
