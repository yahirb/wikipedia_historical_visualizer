{"Manchester": {"Sebbins Pond": "Sebbins Pond is an approximately 20-acre (81,000 m2) body of water in Bedford, New Hampshire. It is located in the eastern part of the town, between Back River Road and the Everett Turnpike. It is named for a man with the last name of Sebbins, who in 1735 set up shop at a site near the pond to make shingles, which he then dragged down to the nearby Merrimack River to ship - two years before the first permanent settlement in Bedford in 1737."}}
