{"Boston": {"Park Street District": "The Park Street District is a historic district encompassing a small cluster of historic properties on or near Park Street in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts. The district covers an entire city block delineated by Park Street, Beacon Street, School Street, and Tremont Street, just east of the Boston Common. The district reflects an early design of the area by architect Charles Bulfinch, although only a few buildings from his period survive.\nThe Amory-Ticknor House (1804), Chester Harding House (1808), Boston Athenaeum (1847), Park Street Church (1807), Granary Burying Ground (1660) and Suffolk University Law School (1999) are all within the district. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974."}}
