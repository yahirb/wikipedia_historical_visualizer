{"North_Little_Rock": {"William L. Terry House": "The William L. Terry House is a historic house at 1422 Scott Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a roughly L-shaped 2-1/2 wood frame structure, its appearance somewhat irregular due to the presence of projecting elements. Its porch extends across part of the front, and then the inside of the L, with bracketed square posts and a spindled balustrade."}}
