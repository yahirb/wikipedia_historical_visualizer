{"Cleveland": {"The Chesterfield Building": "The Chesterfield Building is a 1965-erected high-rise 200 foot tall, 20-story apartment building complex located in the Reserve Square area of downtown Cleveland. The building was designed by Charles Luckman who is responsible for the Aon Center (Los Angeles), the Los Angeles Convention Center, the Madison Square Garden in New York and the AmTrust Financial Center in Cleveland among many others. The complex contains 407 living units and features distinctive windows that open out giving the impression that the building is an old factory, but the building has always been apartments."}}
