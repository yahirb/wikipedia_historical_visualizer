{"Worcester": {"Lydia Blodgett Three-Decker": "The Lydie Blodgett Three-Decker is a historic triple decker at 167 Eastern Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1902, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as a good example of a Queen Anne triple decker. Many of its details have been removed or obscured by later exterior siding replacement and porch reconstruction (see photo)."}}
