{"Flagstaff": {"Robotic Lunar Observatory": "The Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) was an astronomical observatory funded by NASA and located at the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Science Campus atop McMillan Mesa in Flagstaff, Arizona. Its purpose was to enable the Moon to be used as a radiance calibration source for Earth-orbiting remote-sensing spacecraft. The program ceased observations in September 2003, but the facility is maintained for calibration and instrument characterization purposes."}}
