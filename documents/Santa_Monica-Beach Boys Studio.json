{"Santa_Monica": {"Beach Boys Studio": "Beach Boys Studio, also known as Brother Recording Studio, was a private recording studio located within the home of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson at 10452 Bellagio Road, Los Angeles, California. Built in 1967, a number of the band's albums were recorded there in addition to his \"Bedroom Tapes\". Because the other Beach Boys took much of the recording equipment with them when they left for concert tours, Wilson was not typically allowed to use the studio unless the band was present."}}
