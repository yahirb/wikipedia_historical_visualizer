{"Jersey_City": {"Double Check": "In chess, a double check is a check delivered by two pieces simultaneously. In chess notation, it is almost always represented the same way as a single check (\"+\"), but is sometimes symbolized by \"++\" (however, \"++\" is also sometimes used to denote checkmate).\n\n\n== Discussion ==\n\nThe most common form of double check involves one piece moving to deliver check and revealing a discovered check at the same time from a piece it had been blocking."}}
