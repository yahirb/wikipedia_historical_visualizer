{"Lawrence": {"Charles H. Hayes Building": "The Charles H. Hayes Building is a historic former box factory at 14-44 Granite Street, Haverhill, Massachusetts. Built in two phases (1894 and 1911), the building represents the city's industrial growth around the turn of the 20th century. It was built by Charles H. Hayes, whose business empire also included locally important shoe manufacturers, as well as forest lands in four states to supply his operations."}}
