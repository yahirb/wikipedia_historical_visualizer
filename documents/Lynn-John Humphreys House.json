{"Lynn": {"John Humphreys House": "The John Humphreys House, also known as Sir John Humphreys House, is a historic house museum located at 99 Paradise Road in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Although it was long thought to be associated with John Humphrey, an early deputy governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, it was more likely built about 1700, based on architectural analysis. It was originally located on what is now Elmwood Road (a plaque marks the site), but moved to its current location in 1891 as the Olmsted district was developed."}}
