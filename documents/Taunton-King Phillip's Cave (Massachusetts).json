{"Taunton": {"King Phillip's Cave (Massachusetts)": "King Phillip's Cave is a cave in Norton, Massachusetts near Lake Winnecunnett. It may be accessed from Stone Run Drive off Plain Street near Bay Road and sits on a 7-acre (28,000 m2) parcel of land owned by the Land Preservation Society, an independent non-profit conservation organization chartered in 1970 by the State of Massachusetts.\nThe cave is so named because Metacomet, the Wampanoag sachem also known as \"King Phillip\", is said to have hid here near the end of King Philip's War before meeting his death in the Great Misery Swamp in Bristol, RI. According to materials published by The Patriot Ledger:\n\nThe town forest, where King Philip\u2019s Cave is located, and Lake Winnecunnett are both popular recreation sites."}}
