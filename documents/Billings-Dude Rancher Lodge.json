{"Billings": {"Dude Rancher Lodge": "The Dude Rancher Lodge is a motel in Billings, Montana, on the National Register of Historic Places. Known as \"Billings' most unique motel\", it was built in 1950 with a Hollywood-western style theme inside and out with many custom features, most original to the building. Owned for over 40 years by the family corporation of its original owners, with a single change of ownership in 1992, the motel and its attached restaurant is still in operation today and looks much as it did when originally constructed."}}
