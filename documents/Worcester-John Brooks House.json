{"Worcester": {"John Brooks House": "The John Brooks House is an historic house at 12 Nelson Place in Worcester, Massachusetts. The 1.5 story wood frame house was built in the late 1840s by John Brooks, a Princeton native and farmer. The south facade distinctively has three large gables which rise to nearly meet the main ridge line."}}
