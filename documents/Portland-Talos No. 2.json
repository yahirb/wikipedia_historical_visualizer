{"Portland": {"Talos No. 2": "In Greek mythology, Talos (; Greek: \u03a4\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2, Tal\u014ds) or Talon (; Greek: \u03a4\u03ac\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, Tal\u014dn) was a giant automaton made of bronze to protect Europa in Crete from pirates and invaders. He circled the island's shores three times daily. \n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nTalos's bronze nature suggested to the author of Biblioth\u0113k\u0113 that he may have been a survivor from the Age of Bronze, a descendant of the brazen race that sprang from meliae \"ash-tree nymphs\" according to Argonautica 4."}}
