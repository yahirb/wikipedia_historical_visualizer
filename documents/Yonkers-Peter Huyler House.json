{"Yonkers": {"Peter Huyler House": "The Peter Huyler House is located on what is known as the Captain John Huyler Homestead at 50 County Road between Palisades Avenue and Crest Drive North in Cresskill, Bergen County, New Jersey. In 1776, the property was part of a 180-acre (73 ha) farm which belonged to Loyalist John Ackerson or Eckerson. It was confiscated in 1779 because of Ackerson's loyalty to the British, and sold in 1784 to Captain John Huyler of the local militia."}}
