In their first season, between November 2008 and July 2009, Cabaret Red Light staged the series \"The Seven Deadly Sins\". Their second and third series (\"The Experiment\", about a cabaret that builds a time machine, and \"The Seven Deadly Seas\", a pirate and gypsy-jazz show aboard the barquentine Gazela) began in 2010, and they recently performed the premiere of their ballet-and-burlesque version of The Nutcracker based on E. T. A. Hoffmann's original Gothic short story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King."}}
