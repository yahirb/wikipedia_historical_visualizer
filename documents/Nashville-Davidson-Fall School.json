{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Fall School": "The Fall School is the oldest public school building remaining in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.. Built in 1898, it was named after P. S. Fall, a Nashville businessman and member of the Board of Education from 1865-1867. The Fall School was notable because it had individual classrooms, unlike the earlier study hall design."}}
