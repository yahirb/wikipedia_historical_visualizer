{"Fort_Collins": {"Grandview Cemetery, Fort Collins": "Grandview Cemetery is a cemetery in Fort Collins, Larimer County, Colorado.\nThe land for the cemetery was purchased in 1887; at the time it was west of the city limits of Fort Collins. Mountain Home Cemetery had been used prior to this, but it was closer to town, and with the population of Fort Collins rapidly expanding it was deemed necessary to find another location farther from town."}}
