{"Lexington-Fayette": {"Ladies' Confederate Memorial": "The Ladies' Confederate Memorial is an American Civil War monument erected in 1874 in Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky MPS. Unlike most Confederate monuments in Kentucky, it represents grief rather than Southern patriotism.\nThe Ladies Memorial and Monument Association was founded by Mary Cyrene Burch Breckinridge, the wife of John C. Breckinridge, on May 26, 1869, after she saw the unveiling of the Confederate Monument in Cynthiana, Kentucky."}}
