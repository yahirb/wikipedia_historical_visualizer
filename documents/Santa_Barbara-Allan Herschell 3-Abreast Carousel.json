{"Santa_Barbara": {"Allan Herschell 3-Abreast Carousel": "The Allan Herschell 3-Abreast Carousel is a carousel built in 1916 by the Allan Herschell Company. The carousel features 35 hand-carved jumping wooden horses and two hand-carved chariots which serve as benches. The carousel is one of only four large carousels made by the Allan Herschell Company between 1915 and 1927; in addition, the horses on the outer rim feature gentle faces and detailed, deep woodwork, making them a rarity among the company's designs."}}
