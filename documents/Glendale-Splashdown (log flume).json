{"Glendale": {"Splashdown (log flume)": "Log flumes (colloquially known as log rides) are amusement rides consisting of a water flume and artificial hollow logs or boats. Passengers sit in the logs, which are propelled along the flume by the flow of water.\nThe ride usually culminates with a rapid descent and splashdown into a body of water, which may happen more than once (normally the largest drop being just before the end)."}}
