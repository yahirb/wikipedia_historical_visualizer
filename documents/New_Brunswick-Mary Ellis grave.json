{"New_Brunswick": {"Mary Ellis grave": "The Mary Ellis grave is an 1828 gravestone located in the parking lot of a Loew's movie theatre in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\nAfter Mary Ellis's burial, the family home and property eventually became the site for the Great Eastern Discount Department Store and, after that went out of business in the early-to-mid-1970s, the Route 1 Flea Market. Currently, and since about the late 1990s, the site contains an AMC Theater."}}
