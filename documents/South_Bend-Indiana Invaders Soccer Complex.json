{"South_Bend": {"Indiana Invaders Soccer Complex": "The Indiana Invaders Soccer Complex is located in South Bend, Indiana. The complex includes many soccer fields, but is most commonly known for the soccer-specific stadium that the Indiana Invaders use, including the Invaders in the W-League, USL Premier Development League, and the Super Y-League. Every once in a while at the complex, high school football games would be played on campus, but its primary use is for soccer."}}
