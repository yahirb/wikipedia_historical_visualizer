{"Centennial": {"County Line station (RTD)": "The A Line, officially called the University of Colorado A Line for sponsorship reasons, is a Regional Transportation District (RTD) commuter rail line serving Denver and Aurora, Colorado, operating between Downtown Denver and Denver International Airport (DIA). During planning and construction the A line was also known as the East Rail Line, which sometimes it is still called. Despite its official title, the line does not serve the campuses of the University of Colorado."}}
