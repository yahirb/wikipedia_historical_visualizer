{"New_Orleans": {"Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)": "Louis Armstrong Park is a 32-acre (130,000 m2) park located in the Trem\u00e9 neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, just across Rampart Street from the French Quarter.\nIn the 1960s a controversial urban renewal project leveled a substantial portion of the Trem\u00e9 neighborhood adjacent to Congo Square. After a decade of debate, the City created the present-day park from that land."}}
