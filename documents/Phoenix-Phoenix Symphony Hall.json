{"Phoenix": {"Phoenix Symphony Hall": "Symphony Hall is a multi-purpose performing arts venue, located in Downtown Phoenix, Arizona, United States.\nIt was completed in 1972, as part of the Phoenix Civic Plaza and quickly became the home of the People's Pops Concert, founded in 1970 by Theresa Elizabeth Perez, Music Coordinator for the City of Phoenix (1969-1983.) Prior to Symphony Hall opening, the Pops Concerts were performed at Phoenix College. Theresa's Children's Opera Series (Help, Help, the Globolinks! Noye's Fludde and Beauty is Fled) were also presented at Symphony Hall.\nIt is home to the Phoenix Symphony, Arizona Opera and Ballet Arizona.\nIt is also the site for Broadway touring companies, a variety of dance productions, and appearances by popular entertainers, as well as the location for business seminars, and convention general sessions.\nIn June 2004, a $18.5 million renovation took place, in conjunction with the construction of the neighboring Phoenix Convention Center West Building.\nSymphony Hall now features 2,312 chairs, with wood bases for better acoustics. Reconfigured main-floor cross aisles, additional elevators and a new wheelchair seating section, greatly improve accessibility for patrons with disabilities and updates compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. There is a 60-foot x 100 foot stage area, high technology acoustical, lighting, rigging and sound systems, a Green Room, rehearsal hall and star, chorus and musicians dressing rooms.\nIt has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.\nIn popular culture, Phoenix Symphony Hall appears in the Clint Eastwood film The Gauntlet (1977), where it is used as the exterior of \"Phoenix City Hall.\" Eastwood's bus crashes onto the steps of Symphony Hall at the climax of the movie. John Stewart's live album, The Phoenix Concerts, was recorded there.\n\n"}}
