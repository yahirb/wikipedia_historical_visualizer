{"Fall_River": {"Israel Picard House": "The Israel Picard House is a historic house located at 690 County Street in Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nIt is a two-story structure, built out of pink Fall River granite, which is partly obscured by the elaborate wooden Queen Anne porch that wraps around the front and parts of the sides. The house was built in 1897 for Israel Picard, owner of the quarry which provided the stone, and it may have served in part as an advertisement for his products."}}
