{"Portland": {"F.O.J. Smith Tomb": "The F.O.J. Smith Tomb is an historic tomb in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine. It is the tomb of Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith (1806\u201376), US Congressman 1833-39. It was probably built by Smith in 1860, at the time of his daughter Lizzie's death, and is one of Maine's most sophisticated expressions of Egyptian Revival architecture."}}
