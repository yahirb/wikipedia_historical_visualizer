{"Cleveland": {"Children's Museum of Cleveland": "The Children's Museum of Cleveland, once in the University Circle area of Cleveland, Ohio, is now located at 3813 Euclid Avenue in the area known as Midtown off of Chester Avenue.\n\nAs a leader in imaginative and creative play, The Children\u2019s Museum of Cleveland (CMC) gives children a place and the tools to write their own script and discover their own adventures through interactive exhibits and programs. A child will be naturally drawn to those activities that most excite and engage him or her."}}
