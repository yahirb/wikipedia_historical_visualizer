{"Shoreline": {"Haller Lake, Seattle": "Haller Lake is a small lake and neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington, US, named for Theodore N. Haller, who platted the neighborhood in 1905. His father, Granville O. Haller, was one of Seattle's early settlers, an army officer who amassed a large estate in the region.\nThe Duwamish tribe called the lake \"Calmed Down a Little\" (Lushootseed: sees\u00e1hLtub), probably referring to the lake site as a place of refuge during slave raids."}}
