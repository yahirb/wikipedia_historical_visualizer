{"Minneapolis": {"Marquette Plaza": "Marquette Plaza is a highrise in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, located at 250 Marquette Avenue.\n\n\n== Design ==\nDesigned by Gunnar Birkerts, it was home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1973 to 1997 (hence, many people refer to it as \"the old Federal Reserve building\"). Designed much like a suspension bridge, most of the original floors are supported by two sets of catenary cables."}}
