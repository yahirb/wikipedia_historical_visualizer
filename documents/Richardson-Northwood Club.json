{"Richardson": {"Northwood Club": "Northwood Club is a private country club in Dallas, Texas.\nIt hosted the U.S. Open in 1952, won by Julius Boros, which ended Ben Hogan's streak of titles at three in three attempts; the Fort Worth native led after two rounds but finished in third place. Northwood has since been the host of several Regional USGA, local North Texas PGA, and AJGA tournaments."}}
