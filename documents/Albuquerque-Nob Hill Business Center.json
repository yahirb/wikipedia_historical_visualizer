{"Albuquerque": {"Nob Hill Business Center": "Nob Hill Business Center is a historic shopping center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Built in 1946\u20137, it was the first modern suburban shopping center in New Mexico, and its construction marked a shift away from pedestrian-oriented development in Albuquerque in favor of decentralized, auto-oriented sprawl. Located on Central Avenue (former U.S. Route 66) at Carlisle Boulevard, the building is the focal point of the Nob Hill district."}}
