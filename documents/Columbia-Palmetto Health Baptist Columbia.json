{"Columbia": {"Palmetto Health Baptist Columbia": "Palmetto Health Baptist Columbia (Formerly Baptist Medical Center) is a 489-bed acute-care facility located at the intersection of Taylor and Marion Streets in Downtown Columbia, South Carolina. The hospital was established in 1914 as South Carolina Baptist Hospital by the South Carolina Baptist Convention after the widow of Dr. Augustus B. Knowlton, a prominent Columbia physician, asked the church to purchase the hospital, at that time a 70-bed facility on Marion St., that she and her husband started."}}
