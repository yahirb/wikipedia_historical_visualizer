{"Springfield": {"Alvin S. Keys House": "The Alvin S. Keys House is a historic house located at 1600 Illini Road in Leland Grove, Illinois. The house was built in 1929-30 for Republican politician and community leader Alvin S. Keys. At the time, Leland Grove was one of the most exclusive of Springfield's developing suburbs; the Keys House had an especially desirable location, as it was across the street from the Illini Country Club."}}
