{"Atlanta": {"Southern Railway North Avenue Yards Historic District": "The Southern Railway North Avenue Yards, now repurposed as the NorthYards business park, is located just west of the railway line northwest from downtown Atlanta, south of the Marietta Street Artery neighborhood, rich in industrial history. The Yards represent a microcosm in changes in American railroads over the course of the 20th century.\nThe Southern Railway Company first established the complex, as early as 1911, as a turntable rail yard."}}
