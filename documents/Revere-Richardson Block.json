{"Revere": {"Richardson Block": "The Richardson Block is an historic block of commercial buildings at 113-151 Pearl and 109-119 High Streets in Boston, Massachusetts. It consists of a series of buildings constructed in the aftermath of the Great Boston Fire of 1872. The first of these buildings, at the corner of Pearl and High Streets, was designed by William Preston and built in 1873 for Jeffrey Richardson, using granite and brick salvaged from buildings that had previously stood on the site."}}
