{"Richmond": {"Virginia Union University": "Virginia Union University (VUU) is a historically black university located in Richmond, Virginia, United States. It took its present name in 1899 upon the merger of two older schools, Richmond Theological Institute and Wayland Seminary, each founded after the end of American Civil War by the American Baptist Home Mission Society. In 1932, Hartshorn Memorial College, a women's college, merged with VUU. VUU's 84-acre (34 ha) campus is located at 1500 North Lombardy Street in Richmond's North Side."}}
