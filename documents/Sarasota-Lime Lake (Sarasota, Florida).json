{"Sarasota": {"Lime Lake (Sarasota, Florida)": "Whitehead Pond, now known as Lime Lake, is a man made 3-acre (1.2 ha) fresh water pond that was originally built as a storm water pond to catch excess rain waters to help reduce flooding in the area. The pond lies at the easternmost edge of 22nd street in Sarasota, Florida. The pond and its surrounding acreage was originally purchased by Wilmon Whitehead after he returned from World War II in 1947, where he raised his family."}}
