{"Lexington-Fayette": {"Headley Green, Lexington": "Headley Green is a neighborhood in southwestern Lexington, Kentucky, United States. It was built in the early 1990s from land that had previously been a 18-hole par 3 golf course, a putt-putt course and a driving range for public use. It was also lighted so many people like to play at night."}}
