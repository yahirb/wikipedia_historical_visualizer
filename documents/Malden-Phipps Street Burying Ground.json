{"Malden": {"Phipps Street Burying Ground": "The Phipps Street Burying Ground is a historic cemetery on Phipps Street in Charlestown, now a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.\nThe burial ground was created in 1630, when Charlestown was a separate community from Boston; it is the oldest cemetery within Boston's present limits. The \"Charlestown Carver\", an anonymous stone cutter active in the 1660s, began an important regional style that was continued by the Lamson family for many generations."}}
