{"Milwaukee": {"The Reaper (sculpture)": "The Reaper is a public art work by artist Gustav Bohland, located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The bronze sculpture depicts an agricultural worker dressed in overalls and a wide-brimmed hat. One hand rests against his hip, and the other hand grasps the snath of a scythe that rests across his shoulders."}}
