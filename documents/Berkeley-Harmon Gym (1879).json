{"Berkeley": {"Harmon Gym (1879)": "The original Harmon Gymnasium was a gymnasium on the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California. It was the fourth building built on campus, after North Hall, South Hall and Bacon Hall, and the first built with funds from a private donor. In 1878, Albion Keith Paris Harmon, an Oakland businessman, donated $15,000 ($394 thousand in 2017 dollars) to the University for the construction of a gymnasium and assembly hall, which was to be named in his honor."}}
