{"Troy": {"Collar City Bridge": "The Collar City Bridge (also known as the Hoosick Street Bridge) carries NYS Route 7 (NY 7) across the Hudson River connecting Colonie, New York with Troy, by way of passing over Green Island. Though the northern terminus of Interstate 787 (I-787) is unclear, there is sign evidence of a concurrency at least halfway across the bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bridge had been planned since the 1950s, but did not open to traffic until 1981 connecting Troy and Green Island to I-787."}}
