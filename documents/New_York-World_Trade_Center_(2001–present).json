{"New_York": {"World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)": "The World Trade Center is a partially completed complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, New York City, U.S., replacing the original seven World Trade Center buildings on the same site that were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The site is being rebuilt with five new skyscrapers, three of which have been completed, a memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks, and a transportation hub. One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the United States and the Western Hemisphere, is the lead building for the new complex, reaching 104 stories upon its completion on November 3, 2014.\nThe original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened in 1973, and were the tallest buildings in the world at their completion. They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex in a coordinated act of terrorism. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. The resulting collapse of the World Trade Center caused structural failure in the surrounding buildings as well. The process of cleaning up and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months, after which rebuilding of the site commenced.\nAfter years of delay and controversy, reconstruction at the World Trade Center site started. The new complex includes One World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, 7 World Trade Center, and two other high-rise office buildings under construction, which are 3 World Trade Center and 2 World Trade Center. The new World Trade Center complex also includes a museum and memorial, and a transportation hub similar in size to Grand Central Terminal. One World Trade Center was completed on August 30, 2012, and the final component of its spire was installed on May 10, 2013. 4 World Trade Center opened on November 12, 2013, making it the first building completed as part of the site's master plan. 7 World Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, making it the first of five skyscrapers to have been completed in the World Trade Center complex. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum are complete, with the museum opening in May 21, 2014, and the memorial opening on September 11, 2011. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened to the public on March 4, 2016, and 3 World Trade Center is under construction set to be finished in 2018. 2 World Trade Center's full construction was placed on hold in 2009, with a new design announced in 2015."}}
