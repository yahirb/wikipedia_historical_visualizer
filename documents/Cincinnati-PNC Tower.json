{"Cincinnati": {"PNC Tower": "The 4th & Vine Tower (formerly known as the Union Central Tower and Central Trust Bank Building) is a 151 m (495 ft) skyscraper in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. It stands 31 stories tall, overlooking the Ohio River waterfront. It is easily one of the most recognizable buildings in the city's skyline, owing to the elaborate Hellenic architecture in the upper portion of the tower, which was modeled to resemble reconstructions of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus."}}
