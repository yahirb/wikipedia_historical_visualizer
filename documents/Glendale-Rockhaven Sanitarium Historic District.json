{"Glendale": {"Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District": "The Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District is located in the Crescenta Valley at 2713 Honolulu Avenue in what is now the City of Glendale, California. It was opened in 1923 by psychiatric nurse Agnes Richards as a private mental health institution for women with mild mental and nervous disorders as the brochure read. At Rockhaven women could be treated with dignity and grace in a beautiful and serene environment."}}
