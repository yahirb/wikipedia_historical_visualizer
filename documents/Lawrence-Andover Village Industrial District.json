{"Lawrence": {"Andover Village Industrial District": "The Andover Village Industrial District encompasses one of the 19th century industrial mill villages of Andover, Massachusetts known locally as \"The Village\". The growth of this village contributed to the decision in the 19th century to separate the more rural area of North Andover from the town. It is centered on a stretch of the Shawsheen River between North Main Street on the east and Moraine Street on the west."}}
