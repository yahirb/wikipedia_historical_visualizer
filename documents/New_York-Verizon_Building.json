{"New_York": {"Verizon Building": "The Verizon Building \u2013 previously known as the Barclay-Vesey Building and the New York Telephone Company Building \u2013 is a 32-story building located at 140 West Street between Barclay and Vesey Streets, going through to Washington Street, in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The building was constructed from 1923 to 1927, and was designed in the Art Deco style by Ralph Walker of the firm McKenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin. The building is adjacent to the World Trade Center site and 7 World Trade Center, and it experienced major damage in the September 11, 2001 attacks. Its thick masonry exterior and use of masonry to protect steel columns and structural elements helped the building withstand the attacks. Restoration of the building and damaged communications infrastructure after the attacks took three years, at a cost of $1.4 billion.\nThe building, which has been called \"one of the most significant structures in skyscraper design\", was the longtime corporate headquarters of Verizon Communications."}}
