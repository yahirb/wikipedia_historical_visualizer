{"Bellevue": {"East Channel Bridge": "The East Channel Bridge is a bridge carrying Interstate 90 from Mercer Island, Washington, to Bellevue, Washington, over the East Channel of Lake Washington, which separates Mercer Island from the rest of the Eastside.\nThe original bridge was opened November 10, 1923, and was the first bridge to reach the island. George Lightfoot, known as the \"father\" of the other bridge on Mercer Island, the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, had the charge of opening the bridge for boats."}}
