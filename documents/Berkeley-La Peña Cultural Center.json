{"Berkeley": {"La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center": "La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center or La Pe\u00f1a for short, is a Chilean-American culture center in the United States. It was founded in 1975 by two Chilean expatriates on Shattuck Avenue in the Ashby neighborhood of Berkeley, California in response to the 1973 golpe de estado. The center was a focal point for the opposition-in-exile to dictator Augusto Pinochet during his rule, and later evolved into a community gathering place, artist center, entertainment venue, retail store, and left-leaning meeting place which aims to promote community through artists and social activism."}}
