{"Providence": {"Hope Block and Cheapside": "Hope Block and Cheapside are two historic commercial buildings located at 22-26 and 40 North Main Street in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The Hope Block (22-26 North Main) was built in 1869 in the Second Empire style. It was probably designed by Clifton A. Hall, who designed a nearly identical building (the Curry and Richards Building) the year before."}}
