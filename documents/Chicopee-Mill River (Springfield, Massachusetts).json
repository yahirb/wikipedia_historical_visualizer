{"Chicopee": {"Mill River (Springfield, Massachusetts)": "The Mill River is a 1.25-mile (2.01 km) long tributary of the Connecticut River in Springfield, Massachusetts. It flows from Watershops Pond (also known as Lake Massasoit) to its confluence with the Connecticut River. It is referred to as \"The Miracle Mile\" in a 2009 master's thesis that outlines possibilities for reclaiming the river's mouth as a recreational area."}}
