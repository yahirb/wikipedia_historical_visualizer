{"Richmond": {"Carillon Neighborhood Historic District": "The Carillon Neighborhood Historic District encompasses a residential area of western Richmond, Virginia. It is located about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of downtown Richmond, and is roughly bounded on the north and west by the Powhite Expressway and the Downtown Expressway, on the south by the Kanawha Canal, and on the east by Byrd Park. Although this area has a residential history dating into the 19th century (when it was home mainly to country estates), its present architecture is reflective of its development first as a streetcar suburb, and then as a post-World War II housing development area."}}
