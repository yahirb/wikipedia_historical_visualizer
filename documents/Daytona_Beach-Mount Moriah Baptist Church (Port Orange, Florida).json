{"Daytona_Beach": {"Mount Moriah Baptist Church (Port Orange, Florida)": "Mount Moriah Baptist Church was built in Port Orange, Florida in 1911. Built to serve black residents, it was located in an area that came to be known as Freemanville and is believed to be the last remaining building from the settlement. Freed blacks settled the area to work at a lumber company started by John Milton Hawks, but sandy soil, corruption, and planning issues led to a rapid decline as the colony struggled."}}
