{"Salt_Lake_City": {"George M. Cannon House": "The George M. Cannon House, built in 1890, is an historic Late Victorian mansion located at 720 East Ashton Avenue (2340 South) in the Forest Dale area of Salt Lake City, Utah. It was designed by noted Salt Lake architect John A. Headlund for George Mousley Cannon (December 25, 1861 \u2013 January 23, 1937), a member of the Cannon family, a prominent Intermountain West political family. In 1889 George M. Cannon had bought Forest Farm from the estate of Brigham Young and created the subdivision of Forest Dale and later the larger town of Forest Dale, which existed from 1902 until 1912, when it was reabsorbed into Salt Lake City."}}
