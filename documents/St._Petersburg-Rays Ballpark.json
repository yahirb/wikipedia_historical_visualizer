{"St._Petersburg": {"Rays Ballpark": "Rays Ballpark was the name used in project documents for a ballpark in the current location of Al Lang Stadium on the Tampa Bay waterfront in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, proposed by the Tampa Bay Rays as a replacement for Tropicana Field.\nThe Rays had hoped to complete the park in time for the 2012 season, but the proposal did not garner enough public support, and the project was abandoned."}}
