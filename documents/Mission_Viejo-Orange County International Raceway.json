{"Mission_Viejo": {"Orange County International Raceway": "Orange County International Raceway was a combined \u200b1\u20444-mile US dragstrip and 2-mile road course located in Irvine, California adjacent to the Interstate 5 (I-5) Santa Ana Freeway. Under a lease agreement with the Irvine Company, OCIR \u2013 as it was known in racing circles \u2013 was in operation from August 5, 1967 until its closure on October 30, 1983. The track was so named because its founders envisioned hosting sports car, motorcycle, midget, and stock car races in addition to National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) sanctioned drag racing events."}}
