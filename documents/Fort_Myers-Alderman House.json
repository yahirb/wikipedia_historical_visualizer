{"Fort_Myers": {"Alderman House": "An alderman is a member of a municipal assembly or council in many jurisdictions founded upon English law. The term may be titular, denoting a high-ranking member of a borough or county council, a council member chosen by the elected members themselves rather than by popular vote, or a council member elected by voters.\nThe title is derived from the Old English title of ealdorman, literally meaning \"elder man\", and was used by the chief nobles presiding over shires."}}
