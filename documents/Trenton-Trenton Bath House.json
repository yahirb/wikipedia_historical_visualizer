{"Trenton": {"Trenton Bath House": "The Trenton Bath House is a pivotal, influential design by the architect Louis Kahn, with the help of his associate, renowned architect Anne Tyng, at 999 Lower Ferry Road, Ewing Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nIt is neither in Trenton, New Jersey, nor is it a bath house, but the so-called \"Trenton Bath House\" commands attention from architectural historians around the world."}}
