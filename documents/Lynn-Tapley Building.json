{"Lynn": {"Tapley Building": "The Tapley Building was a historic Romanesque building at 206 Broad Street in Lynn, Massachusetts. The five story brick factory building was built in 1890 to replace an earlier factory, which was destroyed in Lynn's 1889 fire. It was built for the firm founded by Philip P. Tapley, which was one of Lynn's leading shoe manufacturers."}}
