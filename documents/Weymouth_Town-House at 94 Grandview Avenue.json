{"Weymouth_Town": {"House at 94 Grandview Avenue": "The House at 94 Grandview Avenue in Quincy, Massachusetts, is the best-preserved of a series of Queen Anne Victorians built on Wollaston Hill. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the 1890s, probably by Horace Briggs, a Boston businessman. It has the complex massing and turret with conical roof that characterize the style."}}
