{"Fayetteville": {"Vernon Fitzhugh House": "The Vernon Fitzhugh House is a historic house at 1551 East Hope Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a T-shaped two-story, built of brown brick, with extensive use of single-pane glass windows and French doors. The house was built in 1962 to a design by Arkansas architect Warren Segraves, and is a good example of Mid-Century Modern residential architecture, with deep overhanging eaves, and unusual placement and size of its windows."}}
