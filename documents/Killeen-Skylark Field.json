{"Killeen": {"Skylark Field": "Skylark Field (IATA: ILE, ICAO: KILE, FAA LID: ILE) is a city owned, public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) east of the central business district of Killeen, a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. It was formerly known as Killeen Municipal Airport.\nThe airport does not currently offer scheduled passenger service on commercial airlines. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, operating as Delta Connection, served this airport until August 2003, when it replaced its turboprop airplanes with regional jets which required a longer runway. In August 2004, the City of Killeen relocated the remaining airlines from Killeen Municipal Airport to new facilities at the Killeen-Fort Hood Regional Airport, which has a longer runway to accommodate larger jets and an expanded terminal to handle more passengers."}}
