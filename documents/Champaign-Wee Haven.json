{"Champaign": {"Wee Haven": "Wee Haven is a historic house located at 1509 West Park Avenue in Champaign, Illinois. The Prairie School house was built in 1925; its design came from a plan which architect Charles Saxby Elwood had published in Fruit, Garden and Home magazine the previous year. As is typical in Prairie School designs, the house has a heavy emphasis on horizontality, as can be seen in its low massing, flat roof with wide eaves, and casement windows with art glass."}}
