{"Renton": {"Boeing Plant 1": "Boeing Plant 1 (also known as Boeing Oxbow Plant) was the second Boeing airplane production facility which was the home of The Boeing Company between 1917 and 1965 in Seattle, Washington, USA. Boeing Plant 1 was responsible for the assembly and production of all aspects of the early Boeing airplane models produced until the completion of Boeing Plant 2 in 1936.\nBy the 1950s Boeing Plant 1 consisted of more than 20 buildings. The facility was made obsolete by the larger airplanes produced in the 1930s, and was used primarily as a forging plant and testing facility, as well as a producer of component parts used in the production of airplanes in other Boeing facilities."}}
