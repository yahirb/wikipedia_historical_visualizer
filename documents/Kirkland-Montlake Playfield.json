{"Kirkland": {"Montlake Playfield": "Montlake Playfield is a 27 acre (100,000 m\u00b2) park and playfield on Portage Bay in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, USA.\nOriginally a 20-foot-deep peat bog, the playfield site was first developed as part of a dahlia farm. The farm extended considerably further south than the present playfield: its southernmost part was south of Lynn Street, the land used to build St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church."}}
