{"Oklahoma_City": {"Lincoln Terrace neighborhood": "Lincoln Terrace is a historic and diverse neighborhood in the Eastside district of Northeast Oklahoma City, located on either side of Lincoln Blvd just south of the Oklahoma State Capitol, between NE 13th and NE 23rd streets.] Most homes in the area were built during the decade (1920\u201330) after the erection of the state capitol. The neighborhood has undergone a renaissance in recent years in part as a result of the expansion of the Oklahoma Medical Center complex, anchored by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, on its south side.\nMost of the homes in the neighborhood are in the Tudor Revival Style\nLocal businesses and organizations in the neighborhood include: Joy Mennonite Church and the Oklahoma Center for Conscience (both on NE 16th Street, west of Lincoln); Papa Dino's Pizza, and George's Happy Hog BBQ, (both on Culbertson Drive), and The OUHSC Faculty House (on NE 14th Street)."}}
