{"Fayetteville": {"Wade-Heerwagen House": "The Wade-Heerwagen House is a historic house at 338 Washington Avenue North in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, built in the 1870s in imitation of pre-Civil War houses more typical of late-18th century Virginia. The house is basically T-shaped, with a front section three bays wide that has a two-story porch extending across its width, and a rear ell added sometime after the house's initial construction."}}
