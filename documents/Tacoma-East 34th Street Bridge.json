{"Tacoma": {"East 34th Street Bridge": "The East 34th Street Bridge is a concrete open-spandrel bridge in Tacoma, Washington. The bridge was built in 1937 to replace a wood bridge that had previously spanned the gulch. The bridge is constructed of two rib arches, that are supported by 24-foot (7 m) support legs, with spandrel columns between the arches and the bridge's 485-foot (148 m) deck."}}
