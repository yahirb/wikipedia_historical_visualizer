{"Oklahoma_City": {"Milk Bottle Grocery": "The Milk Bottle Grocery, located at 2426 N. Classen Boulevard in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is a grocery building with a large metal milk bottle atop its roof. The store was constructed in 1930, and the milk bottle was added in 1948. The bottle was designed to draw attention to the store, as the tall bottle would be visible to automobile traffic along Classen Boulevard, which was part of U.S. Route 66 at the time; it also served as an advertisement for the dairy industry."}}
