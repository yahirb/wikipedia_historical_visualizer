{"Hoboken": {"Exchange Place (Jersey City)": "Exchange Place is a district of Downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, that is sometimes referred to as \"Wall Street West\" due to the concentration of financial companies that have offices there. The namesake is a square, about 200 feet long, at the foot of Montgomery Street at the Hudson River. This square was created by landfilling the shore at Paulus Hook, and has been a major transportation hub since the colonial era."}}
