{"Redlands": {"Crafton, California": "Crafton is an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California, United States, located east of Redlands, south of Mentone and west of Yucaipa, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nCrafton was one of the first communities established in the San Bernardino Valley area. Lewis Cram and his brothers had been in the business of making chairs at San Bernardino de Sena Estancia (also known as Old San Bernardino), but around 1857, they decided to move upstream along the community aqueduct (called the zanja, Spanish for ditch) in order to gain more milling power from the water flow."}}
