{"New_York": {"361 Broadway": "361 Broadway at the corner of Franklin Street and Broadway in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, formerly known as the James White Building, was built in 1881-82 and was designed by W. Wheeler Smith in the Italianate style. It features a cast-iron facade, and is a good example of late cast-iron architecture. The building was renovated by architect Joseph Pell Lombardi in 2000, and a restoration of the facade began in 2009.\nThe building once housed the offices of Scientific American, but it was primarily used in connection with the textile trade. It is currently occupied by a branch of Nyack College.\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark on July 27, 1982, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 15, 1983."}}
