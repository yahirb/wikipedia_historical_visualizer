{"Camden": {"SS United States": "The SS United States is a retired luxury passenger liner built in 1950\u201351 for United States Lines at a cost of $79.4 million ($749 million in 2017). The ship is the largest ocean liner constructed entirely in the United States and the fastest ocean liner to cross the Atlantic in either direction, retaining the Blue Riband for the highest average speed since her maiden voyage in 1952. She was designed by American naval architect William Francis Gibbs and could be turned into a troopship if required by the Navy in times of war."}}
