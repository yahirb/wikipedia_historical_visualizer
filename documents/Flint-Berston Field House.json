{"Flint": {"Berston Field House": "Berston Field House opened in Flint, Michigan, in 1923 and has been the backdrop for the development of some of the city's top boxing and basketball talent as well as an important symbol of race in the city's history.\nBerston is one of several community centers throughout Flint that had traditionally offered recreation and health services to the community. While several have closed, Berston still houses one of the largest youth programs in a city that has had rapid population decline in the last thirty years."}}
