{"New_York": {"SoHo, Manhattan": "SoHo, sometimes written Soho, is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City, which in recent history came to the public's attention for being the location of many artists' lofts and art galleries, but is now better known for its variety of shops ranging from trendy upscale boutiques to national and international chain store outlets. The area's history is an archetypal example of inner-city regeneration and gentrification, encompassing socioeconomic, cultural, political, and architectural developments.\nThe name \"SoHo\" refers to the area being \"South of Houston Street\", and was also a reference to Soho, an area in London's West End."}}
