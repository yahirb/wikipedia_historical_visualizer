{"Jersey_City": {"Lunatarium": "The Lunatarium was an art and music space located in a warehouse loft in DUMBO, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. Managed by DUMBO-based art collective Dumboluna, the Lunatarium was in operation between 2001 - 2004 (although during the last year the space moved from the top floor to the bottom floor of 10 Jay Street). Established in July, 2001, Lunatarium quickly gained notoriety due to the unique nature of the space and events that took place."}}
