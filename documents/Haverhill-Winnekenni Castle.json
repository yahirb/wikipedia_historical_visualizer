{"Haverhill": {"Winnekenni Castle": "Winnekenni Castle is located in the over 700-acre Winnekenni Park Conservation Area, overlooking Kenoza Lake, in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Inspired by stone buildings he saw while visiting England, Haverhill chemist Dr. James R. Nichols built it between 1873 and 1875 as a summer home, and he named it and the surrounding land \"Winnekenni,\" an Algonquin word meaning \"very beautiful.\" It is one of the earliest works of Haverhill architect C. Willis Damon."}}
