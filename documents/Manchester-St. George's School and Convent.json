{"Manchester": {"St. George's School and Convent": "St George's School and Convent are a historic Roman Catholic complex at 124 Orange Street in Manchester, New Hampshire, United States. The school and convent are a pair of connected three-story brick buildings, constructed in 1898-99, along with a church (which is across the street, and now non-denominational Protestant) to serve the large French Canadian community that had migrated south from Quebec to work at the Amoskeag Mills, the city's largest employer. The complex is the only surviving Catholic facility of the period on the east side of the Merrimack River, and is one of its best examples of Romanesque architecture."}}
