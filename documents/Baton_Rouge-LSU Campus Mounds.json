{"Baton_Rouge": {"LSU Campus Mounds": "The LSU Campus Mounds or LSU Indian Mounds are two Native American mounds, of the Archaic Period, on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. They are part of a larger, statewide system of mounds. They were probably used for \"ceremonial and marking point purposes,\" rather than for burial purposes. The 20 feet (6.1 m) tall mounds are thought to be more than 5,000 years old. That date would make them part of the oldest mound system in North America, Mesoamerica or South America and also means they predate the building of the Great Pyramids of Egypt."}}
