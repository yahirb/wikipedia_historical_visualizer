{"Los_Angeles": {"Chinatown station (Los Angeles Metro)": "Chinatown is a neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles, California that became a commercial center for Chinese and other Asian businesses in Central Los Angeles in 1938. The area includes restaurants, shops and art galleries but also has a residential neighborhood with a low-income, aging population of about 10,000 residents.\nThe original Chinatown developed in the late 19th century, but it was demolished to make room for Union Station, the city's major ground-transportation center."}}
