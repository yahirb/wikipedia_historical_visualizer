{"Sandy_Springs": {"Willeo Creek": "Willeo Creek is a 6.7-mile-long (10.8 km) stream in the U.S. state of Georgia, and is located in the north-northwestern part of metro Atlanta. It is a significant tributary of the Chattahoochee River, into which it flows at Bull Sluice Lake, just upstream from Morgan Falls Dam and downstream from the Chattahoochee Nature Center. Together, the two streams form nearly all of the county line between Fulton to the east and Cobb to the west."}}
