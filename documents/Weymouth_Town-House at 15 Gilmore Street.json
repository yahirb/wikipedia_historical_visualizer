{"Weymouth_Town": {"House at 15 Gilmore Street": "The House at 15 Gilmore Street in Quincy, Massachusetts, is a well-preserved Craftsman bungalow. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1908 by Albert Nelson, the builder who developed Gilmore Street in response to the arrival of the railroad in the area in the 1880s. The front-gable house has extended eaves with exposed rafters along the sides, and the front gable projects over the porch, which is supported by thick square pillars on granite posts."}}
