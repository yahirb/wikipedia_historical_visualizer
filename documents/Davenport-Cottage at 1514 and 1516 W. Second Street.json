{"Davenport": {"Cottage at 1514 and 1516 W. Second Street": "The Cottage at 1514 and 1516 West Second Street is a historic building located in a residential-light industrial area of the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. Philippe Oszuscik in his 1979 study of Davenport architecture identified this small cottage as one of the earliest house types in the city. It features a full size front porch that was taken from the Galerie of Mississippi Valley French tradition and a symmetrical, 5-bay main facade that reflects the Georgian and Greek Revival styles."}}
