{"Suffolk": {"Suffolk City Public Schools": "Suffolk City Public Schools is the branch of the government of the city of Suffolk, Virginia responsible for public K-12 education. Like all public school systems in the state, it is legally classified as a school division instead of a school district. Although Virginia school divisions perform the functions of school districts in other U.S. states, they have no independent taxing authority, instead relying on appropriations from their local governments."}}
