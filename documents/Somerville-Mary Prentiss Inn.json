{"Somerville": {"Mary Prentiss Inn": "The Mary Prentiss Inn has historic roots that reach as far back as 1843 and has transformed from a home on Prentiss Street to a Cambridge, Massachusetts inn.\nIn 1843 the home was built by architect William A. Saunders as a wedding gift to his son, William, and his wife, Mary Prentiss. The home was built in the Neo-classical design during the popular Greek revival of 19th century in the United States of America."}}
