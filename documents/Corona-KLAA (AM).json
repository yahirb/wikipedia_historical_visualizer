It is owned by LAA 1, LLC, composed of the owners of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball team, held separately from the baseball club. Studios for KLAA are located on the grounds of Angel Stadium of Anaheim, with the transmitter in Chino, California. 830 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which WCCO (AM) in Minneapolis, Minnesota is the dominant Class A station; for that reason must reduce power from sunset to sunrise."}}
