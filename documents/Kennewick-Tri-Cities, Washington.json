{"Kennewick": {"Tri-Cities, Washington": "The Tri-Cities are a group of three closely tied cities: Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco located at the confluence of the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers in the desert region of Southeastern Washington. Each city borders at least one other city or one of the area's rivers, making the Tri-Cities seem like one uninterrupted mid-sized city. The three cities function as the center of the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, which also includes the city of West Richland."}}
