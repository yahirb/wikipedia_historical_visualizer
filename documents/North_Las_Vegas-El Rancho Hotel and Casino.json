{"North_Las_Vegas": {"El Rancho Hotel and Casino": "The El Rancho Hotel and Casino (formerly known as The Thunderbird and The Silverbird) was a hotel and casino that operated on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada from 1948 to 1992. After its closure, the El Rancho sat vacant for eight years while two companies made several attempts to reopen or replace the resort, which was eventually demolished in 2000, after a news report found the decrepit buildings to be in violation of health and safety regulations. The site later became part of the land used for the un-opened Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas."}}
