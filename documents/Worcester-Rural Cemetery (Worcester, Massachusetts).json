More than 13,000 people are buried at the cemetery, including congressmen, mayors, governors, and professional people.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cemetery was incorporated in 1838 on the quiet outskirts of town, at the suggestion of Edward D. Bangs in 1837 to serve as the town's cemetery, the older cemeteries having been neglected, overpopulated, or trampled by livestock."}}
