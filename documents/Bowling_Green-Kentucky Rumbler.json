{"Bowling_Green": {"Kentucky Rumbler": "Kentucky Rumbler is a wooden roller coaster at Beech Bend Park in Warren County, Kentucky. It has a drop of 80 feet and a height of 96 feet. The ride was a significant addition to Beech Bend Park because before the Kentucky Rumbler was built, the park didn't have a signature unique ride, and even today it is still the most popular ride in the park."}}
