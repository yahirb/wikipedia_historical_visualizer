{"Springdale": {"Price Produce and Service Station": "The Price Produce and Service Station is a collection of three related commercial buildings at 413, 415, and 417 East Emma Avenue in Springdale, Arkansas. It includes one building that hosted an automotive filling station and produce shop, a second that traditionally housed a barbershop, and a third structure, originally open but now enclosed and housing a residence, that was used as an automobile service area. The buildings were all built in 1934, and are united by common Art Deco styling, most prominently lancet-topped pilasters that rise above the height of their roofs."}}
