{"National_City": {"Anthology (music venue)": "Anthology was a 13,000 square foot, 325-seat live music venue and fine dining restaurant located at the south end of the Little Italy neighborhood of San Diego, California. It opened in summer 2007 and captured a modern feel of supper clubs of the 1930s and 40s in downtown San Diego.  With a cost of over $6.5 million to build, including over $1 million spent on sound engineering, acoustics, and state of the art audio and video equipment, this venue quickly garnered national and international attention, and was considered by many of the Grammy award winning artists that played there to be one of the finest venues in the world to play in."}}
