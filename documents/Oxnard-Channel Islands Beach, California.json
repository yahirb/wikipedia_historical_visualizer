{"Oxnard": {"Channel Islands Beach, California": "Channel Islands Beach is an unincorporated community in Ventura County, California, United States consisting of three historic neighborhoods: Hollywood Beach, Hollywood by the Sea, and Silver Strand Beach. This densely populated narrow 1.3-mile-long strip (2.1 km) along the coastal edge of the Oxnard Plain was subdivided using the glamor of Hollywood to sell lots in the mid 1920s since the sand dunes had been used for movies. Adjacent development has left this neighborhood hemmed in by Channel Islands Harbor and Naval Base Ventura County."}}
