{"Boston": {"Sacred Cod": "The Sacred Cod is a four-foot eleven-inch carved-wood effigy of an Atlantic codfish, \"painted to the life\", hanging in the House of Represen\u00adta\u00adtives chamber of Boston's Massachu\u00adsetts State House\u200d\u2014\u200c\"a memorial of the importance of the Cod-Fishery to the welfare of this Commonwealth\" (i.e. Massachu\u00adsetts, of which cod is officially the \"historic and contin\u00adu\u00ading symbol\"). The Sacred Cod has gone through as many as three incarnations over three centuries: the first (if it really existed\u200d\u2014\u200cthe authoritative source calling it a \"prehistoric creature of tradition\") was lost in a 1747 fire; the second disappeared during the American Revolution; and the third is the one seen in the House today.\nSacred Cod is not a formal name but a nickname which appeared in 1895, soon after the carving was termed \"the sacred emblem\" by a House committee appointed \"to investigate the significance of the emblem [which] has kept its place under all administrations, and has looked upon outgoing and incoming legislative assemblies, for more than one hundred years\".[C]:3-4,12 Soon sacred cod was being used in reference to actual codfish as well, in recognition of the creature's role in building Massachu\u00adsetts' prosperity and influence since early colonial times.\nIn 1933 the Sacred Cod was briefly \"Cod-napped\" by editors of the Harvard Lampoon, prompting police to drag the Charles River and search an airplane landing in New Jersey. In 1968 it was taken briefly again, this time by students at the University of Massachu\u00adsetts Boston.\nA fish figure is displayed in the State House Senate chamber as well\u200d\u2014\u200ca brass casting (sometimes called the Holy Mackerel) above its central chandelier."}}
