{"Camden": {"Port of Philadelphia": "The Port of Philadelphia sometimes collectively refers to all the public and private ports and marine terminals located along the Pennsylvania and New Jersey sides of the Delaware River in the Philadelphia region. Most often, however, the term applies to the publicly-owned marine terminals located within Philadelphia city limits along the Philadelphia side of the Delaware River. These terminals are managed by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, PhilaPort, an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."}}
