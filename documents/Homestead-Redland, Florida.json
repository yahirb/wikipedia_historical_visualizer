{"Homestead": {"Redland, Florida": "Redland, also locally referred as The Redlands by those in neighboring communities, is an unincorporated community in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States, about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Downtown Miami. Many farms, original clapboard homes of early settlers, u-pick'em fields and coral rock walls dot the landscape. It was named for pockets of red clay once common in the area, on top of a massive layer of oolite rock."}}
