{"Quincy": {"Sherman Apartments Historic District": "The Sherman Apartments Historic District encompasses four historic residential buildings on Washington and Lyndhurst Streets in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The district consists of three brick six-unit buildings constructed between 1904 and 1906 by Walter U. Sherman. They were built on the site of an 1831 Greek Revival school building, which was moved by Sherman to 18 Lyndhurst Street and converted into a residential duplex."}}
