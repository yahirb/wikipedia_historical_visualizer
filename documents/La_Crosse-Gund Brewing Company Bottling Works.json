{"La_Crosse": {"Gund Brewing Company Bottling Works": "Gund Brewery Lofts or the old Gund Brewing Company Bottling Works was a progressive beer-bottling factory built in 1903, designed by Louis Lehle with modern sanitization and pasteurization machines that gave Gund's beer a reliable shelf life, and electrical power that allowed an efficient plant layout. The factory has now been remodeled as apartments. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places."}}
