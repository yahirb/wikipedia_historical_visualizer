{"North_Charleston": {"Daniel Legare House": "The Daniel Legare House is the oldest surviving house in the historic Ansonborough area of Charleston, South Carolina. The land upon which the house was built was sold to Daniel Crawford in May 1745 for a price that was much lower than expected for a house at the time, thereby suggesting a construction date after that time.\nWhen Crawford's estate sold the property in 1760, the deed included a reference to buildings on the grounds."}}
