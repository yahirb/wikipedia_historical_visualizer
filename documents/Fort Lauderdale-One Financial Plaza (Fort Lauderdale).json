At the time of its opening, it was the tallest building in the Fort Lauderdale area. It has since been surpassed by several buildings. Currently, it is the city's sixth tallest building.\nOne Financial Plaza bears a striking resemblance to the Chase Tower in Amarillo, Texas. They were built around the same time (Chase Tower opened in 1971, the year before One Financial Plaza opened), and Chase Tower is only a few floors taller, at 31 stories."}}
