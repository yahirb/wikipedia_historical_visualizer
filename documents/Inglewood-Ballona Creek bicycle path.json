{"Inglewood": {"Ballona Creek bicycle path": "The Ballona Creek bicycle path is a six-mile stretch of Class 1 bicycle path in Los Angeles that parallels Ballona Creek for its entire length. It starts where Jefferson Boulevard veers south to spawn National Boulevard in Culver City, passes through Del Rey and Playa Vista, and ends by joining The Strand in Playa del Rey. The path passes by the Baldwin Hills and the Ballona Wetlands, and on clear days a view of the Santa Monica Mountains is visible."}}
