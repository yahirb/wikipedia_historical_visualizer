Originally W42AO and then WAGC-LP in Athens, Georgia, its digital replacement is now located at the North Druid Hills tower site, with Atlanta as its city of license. The station transmits on 14, the lowest UHF TV channel, but displays its virtual channel as 50.1 and 50.2, its last analog TV channel after changing from its original 42."}}
