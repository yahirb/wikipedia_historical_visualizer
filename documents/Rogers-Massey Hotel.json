{"Rogers": {"Massey Hotel": "The Hotel Massey (also Town House Hotel) is a former hotel in the Downtown district of Bentonville, Arkansas, built in 1910 in the Renaissance Revival architectural style. The historic property replaced the Eagle Hotel, which had been on the site since 1840. Many businesses have occupied the hotel's first floor, and the structure has contained the Bentonville Public Library twice."}}
