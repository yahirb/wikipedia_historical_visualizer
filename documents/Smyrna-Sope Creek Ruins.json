{"Smyrna": {"Sope Creek Ruins": "Sope Creek Ruins are located at the intersection of Paper Mill Road and Sope Creek in Cobb County, Georgia and are old industrial ruins. These ruins are the remnants of a larger manufacturing complex which drew on the waterpower that the creek produced. During the period 1850 to 1940, a succession of enterprises, from a (fully integrated) paper mill, twine plant, flour mill and hydroelectric power plant occupied an area of about one mile along the creek."}}
