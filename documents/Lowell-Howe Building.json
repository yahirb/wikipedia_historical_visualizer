{"Lowell": {"Howe Building": "The Howe Building is a historic commercial building at 208 Middlesex Street in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts. The four story brick building was built in 1883, and is one of the city's finest Queen Anne commercial buildings. Its architecturally prominent features include a mansard roof (unusual for the style and period), and a large central stepped gable with an arched window at the center."}}
