{"Cambridge": {"William F. Bradbury House": "The William F. Bradbury House is an historic house at 369 Harvard Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The three story brick Second Empire house was built in 1877 by William F. Bradbury, head master of the Cambridge Latin School. The pressed brick construction was rare for Cambridge at the time, and the house is now one of the few single family houses of the period to remain on Harvard Street, which was once lined by single-family houses."}}
