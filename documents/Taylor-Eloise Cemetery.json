{"Taylor": {"Eloise Cemetery": "Eloise Cemetery was the name applied to cemeteries used by the Eloise hospital complex located in what was then Nankin Township in western Wayne County, Michigan, and is now Westland, Michigan. The patients buried in the cemetery were from the Infirmary Division, the William P. Seymour General Hospital, the T.B. Sanitarium and the Eloise Hospital (Psychiatric Division). In the United States at the dawn of the 20th century, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death, and that was true here."}}
