{"Troy": {"Northern River Street Historic District": "The Northern River Street Historic District is located along River Street (southbound US 4 at that point) north of Federal Street, one block east of the Green Island Bridge, in Troy, New York, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, as the Northern River Street District, to distinguish it from Troy's previously existing River Street Historic District, which had been one of five superseded by the Central Troy Historic District to the south two years earlier.\nIts two acres (8,000 m\u00b2) include 13 brick industrial and commercial buildings erected from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries."}}
