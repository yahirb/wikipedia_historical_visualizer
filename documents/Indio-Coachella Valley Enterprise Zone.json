{"Indio": {"Coachella Valley Enterprise Zone": "The Coachella Valley Enterprise Zone Authority (CVEZA) established in 1992 is one of 42 zone authorities competitively designated for 15 years by the State of California. Each enterprise zone promotes, explains, supports, and administers business applications for vouchers issued to its zone businesses that grant certain specific, yet liberal, hiring and sales/use tax credits, business deductions and other incentives that mitigate\u2014and often eliminate\u2014the firm's state income tax obligations. Although under the aegis of the State's Department of Housing and Community Development, a zone authority is funded through various partnership arrangements among city, county or other local government agencies."}}
