{"Santa_Barbara": {"Sambo's": "Sambo's is a restaurant, formerly an American restaurant chain, started in 1957 by Sam Battistone, Sr., and Newell Bohnett. Though the name was taken from portions of the names of its founders, the chain soon found itself associated with The Story of Little Black Sambo. Battistone, Sr., and Bohnett capitalized on the connection by decorating the walls of the restaurants with scenes from the book, including a dark-skinned boy, tigers, and a pale, magical unicycle-riding man called \"The Treefriend\"."}}
