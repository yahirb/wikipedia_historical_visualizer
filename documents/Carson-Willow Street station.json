{"Carson": {"Willow Street station": "Willow Street is an at grade light rail station on the Los Angeles County Metro Blue Line. It has an island platform, and is adjacent to Long Beach Boulevard near the intersection of Willow Street in the city of Long Beach, California. At this point, going Northbound, the Blue Line route leaves Long Beach Boulevard and enters its own right-of-way (part of Pacific Electric Railway's Red Car right-of-way) allowing the trains to reach higher speeds between stops."}}
