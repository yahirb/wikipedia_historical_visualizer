{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Tennessee State Library and Archives": "The Tennessee State Library and Archives (TSLA), established in 1854, currently operates as a unit of the Tennessee Department of State. According to the Tennessee Blue Book, the Library and Archives \"collects and preserves books and records of historical, documentary and reference value, and encourages and promotes library development throughout the state.\" This mandate can be found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 10, Chapters 1-8.\nAlthough most states operate their libraries and archives as separate agencies, Tennessee is one of a handful of states whose library and archives are administered jointly."}}
