The rail depot of that name was located on the line of the Southern Pacific Railroad between San Gabriel and El Monte, at an elevation of 276 feet (84 m).\nSavannah was promoted with considerable dignity in 1887-88 but vanished, nevertheless; the neighborhood of the depot has been absorbed by Rosemead."}}
