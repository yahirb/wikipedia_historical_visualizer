{"Roswell": {"Crestwood High School (Georgia)": "Crestwood High School, on Colonel Drive (Dunwoody, Georgia, United States) in what is now known as Sandy Springs, opened in the Fall of 1972 to relieve overcrowding at nearby Roswell High School and North Springs High School.\nInitially, Crestwood gained reputation as a public funded 'private High School,' a sales pitch used to draw a higher tax base to the area. For the first few years, the faculty and student body of the school remained almost entirely white."}}
