{"Bellevue": {"Sinking Ship": "The Sinking Ship is a multi-story parking garage in Pioneer Square, Seattle bound by James Street to the north, Yesler Way to the south, and 2nd Avenue to the east, and just steps away from the Pioneer Building on the site of the former Seattle Hotel. After the hotel was demolished in 1961, the Sinking Ship was built as part of a neighborhood redesign.\nA writer for HistoryLink described the Sinking Ship as \"that skid road parking garage whose nihilistic construction depresses the flatiron block where James Street and Yesler Way meet at Pioneer Square.\"\nThe parking garage is said to be haunted."}}
