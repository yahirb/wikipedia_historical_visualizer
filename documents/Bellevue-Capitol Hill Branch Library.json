{"Bellevue": {"Capitol Hill Branch Library": "The Capitol Hill Branch is a branch of the Seattle Public Library in the Capitol Hill, Seattle neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, US. The original library, located at Harvard Avenue and Republican Street, opened in 1954 and was named the Susan J. Henry Branch at the request of its benefactor. The Henry Branch was demolished in 2001 and the modern Capitol Hill Branch was opened at the same location in 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original site of the library was formerly Emma Baillargeon Stimson's large home, whose purchase was partly funded by the sale of another Capitol Hill property donated in 1934 to the city by two sons of Horace Chapin Henry and Susan J. Henry."}}
