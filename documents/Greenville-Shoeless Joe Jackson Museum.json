{"Greenville": {"Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum": "The \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson Museum and Library was first opened to the public on June 21, 2008. Located across from Fluor Field in Greenville, South Carolina, the five room brick house in which Shoeless Joe Jackson lived and died in contains a few of his personal belongings and over 2,000 books related to baseball.\nIn 2015, the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum formally petitioned Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred for Jackson's reinstatement to baseball, on grounds that Jackson had \"more than served his sentence\" in the 95 years since his banishment by Kenesaw Landis."}}
