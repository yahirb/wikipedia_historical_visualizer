{"Cicero": {"Dexter Park (Chicago)": "Dexter Park was a horse race track in Chicago built in the years following the Civil War. It was named for a gelding and trotter who had set world records for the mile and inspired the naming of several new towns including Dexter, Missouri and Dexter, Texas.\nDexter Park was the first home of the Chicago White Stockings, one of the oldest professional baseball clubs in operation."}}
