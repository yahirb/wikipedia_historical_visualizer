{"Anchorage": {"Arctic Thunder Air Show": "The Arctic Thunder Air Show is an air show and open house event held biennial at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska since 1990. It is a free event open to the general public and one of the largest public events in Alaska. The 2010 show was marred by a tragedy due to a C-17 transport plane crash just a few days before the event, but it still managed to draw a crowd estimated at least 100,000."}}
