{"New_Bedford": {"Padanaram, Massachusetts": "Padanaram is a coastal village in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, United States. As the Boston Globe stated, \"It's where life slows down.\" The Buzzards Bay swing bridge which opens every hour to allow the many sailboats to pass in and out of the harbor literally slows things down. Locals and visitors alike find the charm in this purposeful pause as this is the quintessential capturing of life in this coastal village."}}
