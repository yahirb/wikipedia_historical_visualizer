{"Worcester": {"Thomas Lumb Three-Decker (Winfield Street)": "The Thomas Lumb Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 44 Winfield Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is an example of the style popular during Worcester's westward expansion, with well preserved Queen Anne styling. Although many details have been lost due to residing since its listing in 1990 on the National Register of Historic Places, it retains decorative turned porch supports and balusters."}}
