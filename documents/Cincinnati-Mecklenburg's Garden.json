{"Cincinnati": {"Mecklenburg's Garden": "Mecklenburg's Garden is a historic restaurant in the Corryville neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Its Italianate building, perhaps constructed as a house, was built circa 1865, but it was converted into a restaurant by 1870. In its earliest years as a restaurant, it was run by John Neeb, who sold it to one of his employees in 1886."}}
