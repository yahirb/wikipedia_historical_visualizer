{"New_York": {"4 World Trade Center": "4 World Trade Center (also known by its street address, 150 Greenwich Street) is a skyscraper that is part of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. The building's groundbreaking took place in January 2008, and it opened to tenants and the public on November 13, 2013. It is located on the southeast corner of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, where the original nine-story 4 World Trade Center stood. Pritzker Prize-winning architect Fumihiko Maki was awarded the contract to design the 978-foot-tall (298 m) building. As of 2016, it is the third tallest skyscraper at the rebuilt World Trade Center, behind One and 3 World Trade Center. However, 2 World Trade Center is expected to surpass the height of both buildings upon completion. The total floor space of the building includes 1.8 million square feet (167,000 square meters) of office and retail space."}}
