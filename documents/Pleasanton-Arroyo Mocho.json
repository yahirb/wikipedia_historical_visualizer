{"Pleasanton": {"Arroyo Mocho": "Arroyo Mocho is a 34.7-mile-long (55.8 km) stream which originates in the far northeastern corner of Santa Clara County and flows northwesterly into eastern Alameda County, California. After traversing the cities of Livermore and Pleasanton it joins South San Ramon Creek to become Arroyo de la Laguna, which in turn flows to Alameda Creek and thence to San Francisco Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\nArroyo Mocho means \"cutoff creek\" because it historically had no outlet but dissipated into the ground after spreading out into many smaller streams between Livermore and Pleasanton."}}
