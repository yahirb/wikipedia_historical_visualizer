{"Hillsboro": {"Oak Knoll Winery": "Oak Knoll Winery is a privately held winery located in the Tualatin Valley near Hillsboro, Oregon, United States. Established in 1970, it is the largest winery in Washington County and produces Pinot noir, Pinot gris, and Chardonnay.\nIts prolific variety of wines owes to its rather unusual lack of its own vineyard."}}
