{"North_Charleston": {"Isaac Holmes Tenement": "The Isaac Holmes Tenement is a pre-Revolutionary house in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1721, Isaac Holmes acquired the parcel upon which 107 Church Street was built. It appears that he built a house on the land, but whatever structure he had built was lost in a fire in 1740 that wiped out many buildings in the area."}}
