{"Kansas_City": {"Paseo Bridge": "The Paseo Bridge was a suspension bridge over the Missouri River in Kansas City, Missouri. Before being replaced by the Christopher S. Bond Bridge, it carried Interstates 29 and 35 and U.S. Route 71 over the river. It was named for The Paseo, a boulevard that connected with the bridge to the south, and continues to do so with the Bond Bridge."}}
