{"Kansas_City": {"Kansas City Public Schools": "Kansas City Public Schools or KCPS (formerly Kansas City, Missouri School District, or KCMSD) is a provisionally accredited school district headquartered at 2901 Troost Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. The district, which lost accreditation in 2011, regained provisional accreditation from the state in 2014. In November 2016, the district announced it had gotten a high enough score on state accountability measures for the State Board of Education to consider full accreditation. However, the state's education commissioner told KCPS she wanted to see sustained progress."}}
