{"Newton": {"Bemis Mill": "The Bemis Mill is a historic former industrial building at 1-3 Bridge Street, in the village of Nonantum, in Newton, Massachusetts. It is now a general office building called the Meredith Building. The building is significant historically as a surviving early industrial building in the city, and for the remnants of unique power distribution and water control facilities that survive."}}
