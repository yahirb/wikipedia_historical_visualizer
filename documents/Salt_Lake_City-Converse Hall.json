{"Salt_Lake_City": {"Converse Hall": "Converse Hall is one of the oldest and central buildings on the campus of Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is a 3-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick and white stone in the Jacobethan and Tudor Revival styles. It was the first building erected for the college in 1906, to a design by Salt Lake City architect William E. Ware, and is a regionally rare example of this unusual architectural style."}}
