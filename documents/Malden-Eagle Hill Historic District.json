{"Malden": {"Eagle Hill Historic District": "The Eagle Hill Historic District is a residential historic district roughly bounded by Meridian, Lexington, and White Streets meeting in Prescott Square in the East Boston neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. This part of East Boston was developed roughly between 1834 and 1900, and includes a remarkable concentration of original housing stock. The neighborhood is dense, with a mix of single-family and multiple-family (generally two- or three-unit) wood frame housing."}}
