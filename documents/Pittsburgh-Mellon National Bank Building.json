{"Pittsburgh": {"Mellon National Bank Building": "Mellon National Bank Building (also known as Lord & Taylor Department Store) at 514 Smithfield Street in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was completed in 1924 after Mellon acquired the property in August 1916 from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad which had their regional offices on the site. Prior to the B&O office the site was the original home to the city's first public high school (Central High) which opened in the fall of 1855. The Classical styled building was designed by architects Trowbridge & Livingston with E.P. Mellon."}}
