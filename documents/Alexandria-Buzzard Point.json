{"Alexandria": {"Buzzard Point": "Buzzard Point is an urbanized area located on the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in the southwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest documented name for the tip of the peninsula that now constitutes the area known as Buzzard Point was Turkey Buzzard Point, in use by 1673 when it appeared on a map published by Augustine Herman, a Bohemian explorer and one of the early settlers of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. This name \u2014 often shortened to Buzzard Point \u2014 remained in use until the federal capital was laid out in the 1790s, at which time it became Young's Point, from one Notley Young, the then owner of the land. Very soon thereafter it was renamed Greenleaf's Point \u2014 or Greenleaf Point \u2014 after James Greenleaf, a land speculator and purchaser of numerous lots in the new city, many of which were located in the vicinity of the Point."}}
