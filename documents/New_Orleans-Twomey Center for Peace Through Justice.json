{"New_Orleans": {"Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice": "Twomey Center for Peace Through Justice at Loyola University New Orleans began in 1947 with the efforts of Fr. Louis J. Twomey, S.J., an early advocate for the rights of labor, and his distribution of the newsletter Christ's Blueprint for the South to his fellow Jesuits. Sixty-nine years later Twomey's efforts have expanded to a variety of programs in support of the faith that does justice."}}
