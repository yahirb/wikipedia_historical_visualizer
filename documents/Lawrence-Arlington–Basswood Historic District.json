{"Lawrence": {"Arlington\u2013Basswood Historic District": "The Arlington\u2013Basswood Historic District encompasses a substantial residential development project of the Arlington Mills Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Roughly bounded by Lawrence, Alder, Arlington, and Juniper Streets, the district includes 89 properties, most of which are triple-deckers or other multiunit housing. The area was developed by the company between 1909 and 1925 to address local issues of overcrowding and poor sanitation."}}
