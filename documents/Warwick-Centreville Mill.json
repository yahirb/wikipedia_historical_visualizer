{"Warwick": {"Centreville Mill": "The Centreville Mill is an historic textile mill at 3 Bridal Avenue in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The mill complex is located on a site that has been used for textile processing since 1794, only four years after Samuel Slater's successful mill operation was established in Pawtucket. The oldest surviving buildings on the east side of the Pawtuxet River date to the 1860s."}}
