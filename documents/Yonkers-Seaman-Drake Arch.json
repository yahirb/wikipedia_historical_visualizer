{"Yonkers": {"Seaman-Drake Arch": "The Seaman-Drake Arch, also known as the Inwood Arch, located at 5065 Broadway at West 216th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City is a remnant of a hilltop estate built in 1855 by the Seaman family. The arch, which was built from Inwood marble quarried nearby, is 35 feet (10.67 m) tall, 20 feet (6.10 m) deep, and 40 feet (12.19 m) wide, and was once the gateway to the estate.\nToday, the arch, which is said to be modeled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, is partially obscured from view by low-rise commercial buildings, and has been tagged by graffitists; its soft marble facade is decaying."}}
