{"Tallahassee": {"Maclay School": "Maclay School is a private, not for profit, non-sectarian college preparatory school located on about 100 acres (40 ha) of land in Leon County, Florida, about ten miles (16 km) north of the state capitol building in Tallahassee, FL.\nAlthough the school is open today to students of all races, it was founded by a group of white parents in 1968, in response to the federally mandated racial integration of Leon County Schools. (See Segregation academies.) It was named in memory of Alfred B. Maclay, Jr., a World War II veteran whose mother was a major benefactor; his father's nearby estate became Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park. Maclay is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the Florida Council of Independent Schools (FCIS), and the Florida Kindergarten Council."}}
