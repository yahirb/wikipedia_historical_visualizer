{"Chicago": {"National Surgical Quality Improvement Program": "The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) was started in the American Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In the mid-1980s the VHA was criticized for their high operative mortality. To that end, Congress passed Public Law 99-166 in December 1985 which mandated the VHA to report their outcomes in comparison to national averages and the information must be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of illness of the VHA surgical patient population."}}
