{"Johns_Creek": {"Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers": "The Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE), formerly the Institute of Industrial Engineers, is a professional society dedicated solely to the support of the industrial engineering profession and individuals involved with improving quality and productivity.\nThe institute was founded in 1948 and was called the American Institute of Industrial Engineers until 1981, when the name was changed to reflect its international membership base. The name was changed to the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers in 2016 to align the association with the changing scope of the profession that, while keeping its industrial base, has seen more industrial and systems engineers (ISEs) working with large-scale, integrated systems in a variety of sectors."}}
