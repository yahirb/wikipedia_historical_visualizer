{"Hoboken": {"Tenjune": "Tenjune was a nightclub in New York City's Meatpacking District, located on Little West 12th Street in Manhattan. The music played in the club ranges from hip-hop to techno.\nThe club began receiving media attention in February 2007 due to its celebrity clientele, but it came under public pressure in August 2010 when it was revealed that it had allowed the 17-year-old daughter of Eric G. John, the U.S Ambassador to Thailand, to enter and drink at the club; later that night, the girl died in a fall from the 22nd floor of a midtown apartment building."}}
