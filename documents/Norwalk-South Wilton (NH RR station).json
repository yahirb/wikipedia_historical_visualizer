{"Norwalk": {"South Wilton (NH RR station)": "South Wilton was a station on the Danbury Branch of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, located at the Norwalk-Wilton line, north of a grade crossing with Kent Road. The station opened as Kent, on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad, in 1852. When the Housatonic Railroad leased the D&N in 1886, the name was changed to South Wilton - perhaps to distinguish it from the station in the town of Kent."}}
