{"Flint": {"Shooting of Kayla Rolland": "Kayla Rolland (12 May 1993 \u2013 29 February 2000) was an American 6-year-old girl from Mount Morris Township, Michigan, who was murdered on February 29, 2000. Rolland was shot and killed by her classmate Dedrick Owens, also 6-years-old, at Buell Elementary School in the Beecher Community School District. The murder drew worldwide attention due to the particularly young ages of the victim and the perpetrator: Rolland was the youngest school shooting victim in the United States until the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, and Owens remains the youngest school shooting perpetrator to-date."}}
