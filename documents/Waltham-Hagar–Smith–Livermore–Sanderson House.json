{"Waltham": {"Hagar\u2013Smith\u2013Livermore\u2013Sanderson House": "The Hagar\u2013Smith\u2013Livermore\u2013Sanderson House is a historic house at 51 Sanders Lane in Waltham, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in several stages, and is considered to be the city's oldest surviving structure. Its oldest portion, now an ell attached to the main block, may have been built as early as 1716 (according to deed research), although architectural evidence suggests a date in the mid-18th century."}}
