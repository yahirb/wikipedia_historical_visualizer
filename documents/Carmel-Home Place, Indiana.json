{"Carmel": {"Home Place, Indiana": "Home Place is an unincorporated community of 1,017 acres (412 ha) in Clay Township, Hamilton County, Indiana, in the United States. Home Place has resisted annexation attempts by neighboring Carmel, Indiana, which completely surrounds it, since at least 2004. However, in June 2016, a special judge ruled that residents of Home Place had failed to meet all the requirements to prevent the annexation, and that Carmel could move forward with the annexation."}}
