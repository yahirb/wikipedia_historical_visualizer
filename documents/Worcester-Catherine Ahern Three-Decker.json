{"Worcester": {"Catherine Ahern Three-Decker": "The Catherine Ahern Three-Decker is a historic triple decker at 215 Cambridge Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is a well-preserved example of a triple-decker that predates the popularity of that building type. Built in 1888, it has Italianate design details, including a low pitch hipped roof, and a decorated porch sheltering the front door."}}
