{"Alexandria": {"Center for Individual Freedom": "The Center for Individual Freedom (CFIF) is an Alexandria, Virginia based U.S. nonprofit conservative policy advocacy organization, founded on the principle of securing individual freedoms as embodied in the United States Constitution and state constitutions. It was founded in 1998 by former tobacco industry executives who sought to counter government restrictions on smoking, but is no longer associated with tobacco or smoking. The group focuses on three activities: legal (litigation support), legislative (lobbying), and educational (publications and seminars)."}}
