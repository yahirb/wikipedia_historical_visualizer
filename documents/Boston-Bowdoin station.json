{"Boston": {"Bowdoin station": "Bowdoin station () is a rapid transit station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the MBTA Blue Line. It is located in Bowdoin Square in the Beacon Hill neighborhood. It is the downtown terminus of the line (though Government Center served this role during nights and weekends from 1982 to 2014).\nBowdoin station is not handicapped accessible due to the tight dimensions of the 1916-built station. Bowdoin and Wollaston are the only heavy rail MBTA stations that are not accessible."}}
