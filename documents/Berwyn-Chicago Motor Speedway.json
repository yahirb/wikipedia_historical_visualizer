{"Berwyn": {"Chicago Motor Speedway": "The Chicago Motor Speedway at Sportsman's Park located in Cicero, Illinois, just outside Chicago, was built in 1999 by a group including Chip Ganassi, owner of Chip Ganassi Racing. In 2002 the 1.029-mile (1.656 km) oval shaped track suspended operations due to financial conditions in the motorsports industry. The track was also the site of horse races, when the track was called \"Sportsman's Park\"."}}
