{"Fresno": {"Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill": "Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill, opened in 1935 in Fresno, California, was the first modern landfill in the U.S., pioneering the use of trenching, compacting, and daily burial to combat rodent and debris problems. It became a model for other landfills around the country, and one of the longest-lived. The landfill was operated by the City of Fresno until it closed in 1989."}}
