{"Hoboken": {"Richmond Hill (Manhattan)": "Richmond Hill was a colonial estate in Manhattan, New York City, that was built on a 26-acre (110,000 m2) parcel of the \"King's Farm\" obtained on a 99-year lease in 1767 from Trinity Church by Major Abraham Mortier, paymaster of the British army in the colony. Part of the site is now the Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District of Manhattan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house stood southeast of the modern intersection of Varick and Charlton Streets and some 100 to 150 yards west of the informal footpath that crossed the ditch in Lispenard's Meadows with a plank, and connected the city with Greenwich Village, which lay north and east of Richmond Hill."}}
