{"Hartford": {"West Boulevard Historic District": "The West Boulevard Historic District encompasses a historic residential development on West Boulevard and Rodney Street in the West End of Hartford, Connecticut. The area was developed beginning in 1909, and most of its homes were built by a single construction firm, creating a neighborhood appearance unified by style, scale, and setting, using the principles of the then-fashionable City Beautiful movement. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007."}}
