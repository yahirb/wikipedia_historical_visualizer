{"Newport_Beach": {"Diego Sep\u00falveda Adobe": "The Diego Sep\u00falveda Adobe (sometimes known as the Costa Mesa Estancia or the Santa Ana Estancia) is an adobe structure in Costa Mesa, Orange County, California.  \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe adobe was built between 1817 and 1823 to house the mayordomo and herdsmen who tended the cattle and horses from Mission San Juan Capistrano to the south, in Alta California. The way-station was strategically situated on the banks of the Santa Ana River, some six leguas (Spanish Leagues) north of the parent mission, and also served as a lookout post when the French privateer Hippolyte de Bouchard attacked San Juan Capistrano on December 14, 1818."}}
