{"West_Allis": {"Cleopatra's Wedge": "Cleopatra's Wedge is an 18-foot-tall (5.5 m) carbon steel sculpture currently on display at the Burns Commons in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is part of a growing roster of public art found within the city.\n\n\n== Description ==\nCreated in 1991 by Brooklyn born artist Beverly Pepper and carved from an abandoned freeway corridor, the piece has been described by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as \"slicing into the sky like a tool left behind by Paul Bunyan.\" It is made from Cor-ten, a favorite among outdoor artists, which naturally oxidizes while maintaining a deep rustlike appearance."}}
