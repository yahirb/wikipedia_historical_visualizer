{"Yonkers": {"John William Draper House": "The Henry Draper Observatory, also known as Draper Cottage, is located on US 9 in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, United States. Henry Draper, 1837-1882, created an observatory on the estate of his father, John William Draper. It was here that he made astrophotography history, taking some of the earliest photographs of the Moon to include identifiable features through a telescope in 1863."}}
