{"Skokie": {"Skokie, Illinois": "Skokie (; formerly Niles Center) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Its name comes from a Potawatomi word for \"marsh.\" A Chicago suburb, for many years Skokie promoted itself as \"The World's Largest Village.\" Its population, according to the 2010 census, was 64,784. Skokie's streets, like that of many suburbs, are largely a continuation of the Chicago street grid, and the village is served by the Chicago Transit Authority, further cementing its connection to the city."}}
