{"Portland": {"Hamblen Block": "The Hamblen Block or Hamblen's Row is a historic series of four row houses at 188-194 Danforth Street in Portland, Maine. Built in 1835, it is one of the oldest such buildings in the state, and also a rare example, as comparatively few row houses were built anywhere in the state. The row houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and are a contributing property to the larger Hamblen Development Historic District."}}
