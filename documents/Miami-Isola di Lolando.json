{"Miami": {"Isola di Lolando": "Isola di Lolando is an unfinished artificial island in Biscayne Bay, Florida. Hurricane damage and economic collapse caused the project to be abandoned shortly after the start of construction, but pilings remain visible in the bay and are a hazard to navigation.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1920s, audacious developers like John S. Collins were known for selling pre-construction property in the middle of Biscayne Bay before the islands had even been built."}}
