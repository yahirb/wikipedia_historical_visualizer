{"Bowie": {"Don S. S. Goodloe House": "The Don S. S. Goodloe House, a 1915\u201316 Colonial Revival style building veneered with brick, is significant for its association with Don Speed Smith Goodloe, the first principal of the Maryland Normal and Industrial School. The school, now Bowie State University, was Maryland's first postsecondary school for African Americans. As principal of the school from its opening in 1911 until 1921, Goodloe directed and managed this public institution through its formative years, a period characterized by the state's unwillingness to provide adequate funding for the housing and training of the students, while two white normal schools under the state were well funded."}}
