{"Houston": {"Shadyside, Houston": "Shadyside is a private, walled subdivision of 16 houses in Houston, Texas. In 2012 Terrence McCoy of the Houston Press said that Shadyside has a \"sense of exclusivity, or as Heritage Texas Properties puts it, 'mystique,'\" which caused many prominent figures from Houston to settle in Shadyside and continue doing so for a period of almost 100 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nJoseph S. Cullinan, an oil baron who founded Texaco, bought the land that would become Shadyside in 1916."}}
