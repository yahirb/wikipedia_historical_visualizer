{"Boston": {"Southworth & Hawes": "Southworth & Hawes was an early photographic firm in Boston, 1843\u20131863. Its partners, Albert Sands Southworth (1811\u20131894) and Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808\u20131901), have been hailed as the first great American masters of photography, whose work elevated photographic portraits to the level of fine art. Their images are prominent in every major book and collection of early American photography.\nSouthworth & Hawes worked almost exclusively in the daguerreotype process. Working in the 8 \u00bd x 6 \u00bd inch whole plate format, their images are brilliant, mirror-like, and finely detailed. Writing in the Photographic and Fine Art Journal, August 1855, the contemporary Philadelphia daguerreotypist Marcus Aurelius Root paid them this praise: \"Their style, indeed, is peculiar to themselves; presenting beautiful effects of light and shade, and giving depth and roundness together with a wonderful softness or mellowness. These traits have achieved for them a high reputation with all true artists and connoisseurs.\" He further noted that the firm had devoted their time chiefly to daguerreotypes, with little attention to photography on paper."}}
