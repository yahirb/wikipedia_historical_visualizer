{"Santa_Cruz": {"Rancho Refugio": "Rancho Refugio was a 12,147-acre (49.16 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Santa Cruz County, California given in 1839 by Governor Juan B. Alvarado to Mar\u00eda Candida, Jacinta, and Mar\u00eda de los Angeles Castro. The grant extended along the Pacific coast from the western city limit of Santa Cruz to Laguna Creek, a border shared with Rancho Arroyo de la Laguna (not far from Davenport).\n\n\n== History ==\nAs Mission Santa Cruz developed following its establishment in 1791, the coastal terrace lands to the north as far as Point A\u00f1o Nuevo became the mission's main livestock grazing lands."}}
