{"Worcester": {"Salisbury Mansion and Store": "The Salisbury Mansion and Store is an historic house museum at 40 Highland Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The house was originally built on Lincoln Square in 1772 by Stephen Salisbury I with an attached storehouse from which he sold imported goods under the name S. & S. Salisbury. He and his brother Samuel had originally been in business together selling hardware goods in Boston, and Stephen moved to Worcester to expand the operation."}}
