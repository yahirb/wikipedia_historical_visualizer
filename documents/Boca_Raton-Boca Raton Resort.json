{"Boca_Raton": {"Boca Raton Resort": "The Boca Raton Resort & Club, which opened February 6, 1926 as the Cloister Inn, is a large resort and membership-based club located in Boca Raton, Florida. Originally designed by California-born architect, Addison Mizner, it was intended to have been the second of two hotels, with the other an oceanfront hotel. However, the Ritz-Carlton Investment Corporation became involved in the project, and wanted the oceanfront hotel redesigned, so construction began on the then-smaller 100 room inn on the west side of Lake Boca Raton."}}
