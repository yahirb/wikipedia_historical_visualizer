{"New_Bedford": {"Prince Henry the Navigator Park": "Prince Henry the Navigator Park on Pope's Island in New Bedford, Massachusetts is dedicated to Prince Henry the Navigator, and was created in 1994. It was a gift to the city from the Prince Henry Society of New Bedford and the Portuguese government.\nThe park sits between New Bedford and Fairhaven, between the fishing docks of both cities, looking out toward the hurricane barrier in the New Bedford Harbor and Buzzards Bay beyond."}}
