{"Birmingham": {"Brookwood Village": "Brookwood Village is a 750,754-square-foot (69,747 m2) upscale shopping mall located near Birmingham in \"the cities of Mountain Brook and Homewood, Alabama\".\n\n\n== History ==\nConstructed in 1973 by the Shepherd family, the original building was designed by Giattina Fisher Aycock Architects and won a design award that year from Shopping Center World Magazine. Because the mall is located next to a stream bed with weak soil, the foundation for the mall is built in deep piles bearing on rock strata."}}
