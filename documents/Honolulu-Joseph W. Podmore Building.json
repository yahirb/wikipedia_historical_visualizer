{"Honolulu": {"Joseph W. Podmore Building": "The Joseph W. Podmore Building on the corner of Merchant and Alakea streets in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi was built in 1902 by Joseph W. Podmore, an English sailor who did business in Honolulu during the early 1900s. He built it to rent out for retail and office use, initially to a tailor and a decorator on the ground floor and to the Mercantile Printing Company upstairs. At the time it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 24 March 1983, the Bon-Bon Cafe was its principal tenant and the name by which the building was once better known."}}
