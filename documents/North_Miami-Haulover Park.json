{"North_Miami": {"Haulover Park": "Haulover Park is a 99-acre (40 ha) urban nude beach in metropolitan Miami, just north of Bal Harbour, Florida. The park is located on a shoal between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, just north of the Broad Causeway (SR 922) and Collins Avenue.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Dade County Commission procured the beach front property in 1940 following a lobbying effort for a $2 million municipal bond ($34.9 million, adjusted for current inflation) by county commissioner Charles H. Crandon for the purchases of northern Key Biscayne (what became Crandon Park) and the beach north of Baker's Haulover Inlet, then called Ocean Beach."}}
