{"Cleveland": {"Quicken Loans Arena": "Quicken Loans Arena, also known as \"The Q\", is a multi-purpose arena in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The building is the home of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League, and the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League. It also serves as a secondary arena for Cleveland State Vikings men's and women's basketball.\nThe arena opened in October 1994 as part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex with adjacent Progressive Field, which opened in April of that year. It is named for the retail mortgage lender Quicken Loans, whose chairman and founder is Dan Gilbert, the majority owner of the Cavaliers, Monsters, and Gladiators. From its opening until August 2005, it was known as Gund Arena, named for former Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund, after he paid for the naming rights. The Q replaced the Richfield Coliseum as the primary entertainment facility for the region and the home of the Cavaliers, and supplanted the Wolstein Center at Cleveland State University, which opened in 1990, as the primary concert and athletic venue in downtown Cleveland.\nQuicken Loans Arena seats 20,562 people in its basketball configuration and up to 20,056 for ice hockey, making it the second-largest arena in the NBA by seating capacity. It is a frequent site for concerts and other athletic events such as the men's and women's basketball tournaments of the Mid-American Conference (MAC), hosting the men's tournament since 2000 and the women's tournament since 2001. It has also been the host venue for the 2007 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Final Four, opening and regional semifinal games in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, and the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 2000 and 2009. In July 2016, The Q hosted the 2016 Republican National Convention."}}
