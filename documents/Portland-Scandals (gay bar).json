{"Portland": {"Scandals (gay bar)": "Scandals, or sometimes Scandals PDX, is a gay bar in Portland, Oregon, in the United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn 2015, Willamette Week said, \"Scandals touts itself as 'Gay Cheers,' and it more than lives up to it, full of years-long regulars and yet immediately welcoming to the red-headed stranger wandering through. It feels like the friendliest place in town, from its always-packed landing strip of a patio, to a bar lined with flirtatious singletons, to its tiny, Timbers-watching TV corner tucked away to one side."}}
