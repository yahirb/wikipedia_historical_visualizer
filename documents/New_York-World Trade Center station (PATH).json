{"New_York": {"World Trade Center station (PATH)": "World Trade Center is a terminal station on the PATH system. Located within the World Trade Center in the Financial District neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, it is served by the Newark\u2013World Trade Center line at all times and the Hoboken\u2013World Trade Center line on weekdays. World Trade Center serves as the eastern terminus of both lines.\nThe station was originally opened on July 19, 1909, as Hudson Terminal. As part of the construction of the World Trade Center, Hudson Terminal was torn down, rebuilt as World Trade Center, and re-opened on July 6, 1971. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, a temporary station opened in 2003. The main station house, the Oculus, opened on March 3, 2016, and the terminal was renamed the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, or World Trade Center for short.\nThe World Trade Center station has five tracks and four platforms in the middle of a turning loop. Trains from New Jersey use the loop to turn around and head back to New Jersey. It is located four floors below ground level. The $4 billion Oculus station house consists of white ribs that interlock high above the ground. It was designed to connect the various modes of transportation in Lower Manhattan, from the Fulton Center in the east to the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal in the west. The Westfield World Trade Center mall is also located within the Oculus building. The new station has been controversial due to its high costs and extended delays."}}
