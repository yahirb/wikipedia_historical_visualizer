{"Boston": {"Union Wharf": "Union Wharf is an historic wharf at 295-353 Commercial Street in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. The wharf began as a more modest wooden structure in the late 18th century, and was developed with a complex of granite buildings roughly between 1830 and 1850. It was one of the major centers of trade on the Port of Boston in the mid-19th century, and served as a passenger terminal later in the 19th century."}}
