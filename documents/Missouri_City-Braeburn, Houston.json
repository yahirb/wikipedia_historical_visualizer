{"Missouri_City": {"Braeburn, Houston": "Braeburn is a community of subdivisions in southwest Houston, Texas along Brays Bayou west of Hillcroft Avenue and south of the Sharpstown community. The first of these middle class subdivisions was developed after World War II at a time when the Richmond Farm-to-Market Road (later renamed as Bissonnet Street) provided the route into the city, rather than U.S. Highway 59. Development continued into the 1970s."}}
