{"North_Charleston": {"Charleston County Courthouse": "Charleston County Courthouse (1790\u201392) is a Neoclassical building in Charleston, South Carolina, designed by Irish architect James Hoban. It was a likely model for Hoban's most famous building, the U.S. White House, and both buildings are modeled after Leinster House, the current seat of the Irish Parliament in Dublin.\nPresident George Washington visited Charleston on his Southern Tour in May 1791, may have met with Hoban, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, (the temporary national capital) in June 1792."}}
