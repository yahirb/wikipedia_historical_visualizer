{"Fall_River": {"Pine Street School": "The Pine Street School is a historic former school building located at 880 Pine Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. The wood-framed school was built in 1876 in the Italianate style. It was built in a particularly restrained style after complaints were made about the cost associated with the elaborate decorations of the Border City School (now demolished)."}}
