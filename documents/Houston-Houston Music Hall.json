{"Houston": {"Houston Music Hall": "Houston Music Hall was a 2,200 seat music venue located in Houston, Texas. The venue opened in November 1937. It was located at 801 Bagby Street, near downtown. It was built in conjunction with the Sam Houston Coliseum, which was adjacent to the hall. The hall and coliseum complex replaced the Sam Houston Hall, which was a wooden structure that had been erected on the site for the 1928 Democratic National Convention and torn down in 1936.\nThe hall was demolished in 1998. The former site of the building was redeveloped into the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, which opened its doors in 2003."}}
