{"Yakima": {"Vagabond Army Heliport": "Vagabond Army Heliport, formerly Vagabond Army Airfield, is located at the Yakima Training Center (YTC) in the state of Washington. Currently, only rotary winged aircraft are authorized to land at this facility as the airfield has been closed to fixed-wing aircraft. The existing 1,600-foot (490 m) runway currently serves as a hover lane for approaches and departures."}}
