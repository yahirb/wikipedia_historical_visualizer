It took on the same spirit as the Century Club of New York City: a comfortable, even opulent, place for member artists and art amateurs to work, stay, and socialize.\nIts charter proclaimed:\n\nThe objects of the Club shall be to advance the knowledge and love of the Fine Arts, through the exhibition of works of Art, the acquisition of books and papers for the purpose of forming an Art library, lectures upon subjects pertaining to Art, receptions given to men or women distinguished in Art, Literature, Science or Politics, and by other kindred means, and to promote social intercourse among its members."}}
