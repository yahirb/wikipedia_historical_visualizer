{"Pittsburgh": {"Pittsburgh gasometer explosion": "The Pittsburgh gasometer explosion, or Equitable Gas explosion, was an accident that took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the morning of November 14, 1927. A huge cylindrical gasometer, the largest in the world at that time at 5 million cubic feet (140,000 m3), developed a leak, and repairmen were sent to fix it. The exact cause of the explosion is not known, but some of those repairing the leak were using acetylene torches."}}
