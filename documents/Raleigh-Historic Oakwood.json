{"Raleigh": {"Historic Oakwood": "Historic Oakwood is a neighborhood in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, on the National Register of Historic Places, and known for its Historic Oakwood Cemetery, its many Victorian houses and its location close to the Mordecai Plantation Manor. Located near the Governor's Mansion and the State Capitol, during the 19th century Historic Oakwood was home to prominent members of Raleigh's society. It is Raleigh's earliest white middle-class suburb, and unlike later suburbs, it developed lot-by-lot over time, instead of by platted sections."}}
