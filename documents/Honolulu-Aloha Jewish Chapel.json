{"Honolulu": {"Aloha Jewish Chapel": "Aloha Jewish Chapel was built in 1975 on the grounds of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was designed by Vladimir Ossipoff  as the first free-standing Jewish chapel built by the United States government exclusively for Jewish worship. (The Commodore Levy Chapel, Naval Station Norfolk, is the Navy's oldest Jewish Chapel, but it is part of a larger Chapel complex.) The congregation raised money for and purchased a new Torah scroll, which was dedicated on October 26, 2008."}}
