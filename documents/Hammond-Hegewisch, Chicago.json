{"Hammond": {"Hegewisch, Chicago": "Hegewisch (pronounced  \"heg-wish\" by the locals) is one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, Illinois, located on the city's far south side. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Riverdale and South Deering to the west, the East Side to the north, the village of Burnham to the south and the city of Hammond, Indiana to the east. The community area is named for Adolph Hegewisch, the president of U.S. Rolling Stock Company who hoped to establish \u201can ideal workingman's community\u201d when he laid out the town along a rail line in 1883, six years before Chicago annexed the town."}}
