{"Quincy": {"House at 92 Willard Street": "The House at 92 Willard Street in Quincy, Massachusetts, is, somewhat oddly, believed to be the only granite house ever built in the city, which is well known for its granite quarries. The house is located in West Quincy, near its famous granite quarries, and was built in the 1830s. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, fashioned out of granite blocks, with a gable roof."}}
