{"Council_Bluffs": {"Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge": "The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge is a 3,000-foot (910 m) footbridge across the Missouri River between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska. It opened on September 28, 2008.\nInterest in a landmark bridge across the Missouri River arose after Omaha and Council Bluffs began replacing their older crossings with girder bridges which do not have towers (most notably the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge)."}}
