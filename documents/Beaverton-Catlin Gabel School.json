{"Beaverton": {"Catlin Gabel School": "Catlin Gabel School is an independent preschool through 12th grade private school in West Haven-Sylvan, a census-designated place in Washington County and the Portland metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Oregon.\n\n\n== History ==\nWith roots that go back to 1859, the school was formed by the 1957 merger between the Catlin Hillside School (founded in 1911 as Miss Catlin's School, named after the founder Ruth Catlin) and the Gabel Country Day School (originating as the Portland Academy, named after founder Priscilla Gabel). The school had initially hoped to expand onto the Gabel school property, but lost it to eminent domain."}}
