{"Livonia": {"Farmington Winery (Michigan)": "The Farmington Winery was the former LaSalle Winery which was operated in the converted Detroit United Railway Powerhouse in Farmington, Michigan. Production ceased in the late 1960s and the building was used primarily as a distribution center. Later, the St Julian Winery purchased the LaSalle brand."}}
