{"Wilmington": {"Bellevue Range Rear Light": "Bellevue Range Rear Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Delaware, United States, on the mouth of the Christina River on the Delaware River, Wilmington, Delaware\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bellevue Range Rear Lighthouse is a pyramidal skeletal light tower built in 1909 on the grounds of a landfill. It was operated by resident keepers from 1909 until 1934 when it was automated. The Bellevue Range Rear light was deactivated in 2001 when the landfill grew too high to see the light, and a modern tower was built to replace it."}}
