{"New_York": {"The World Trade Center Tapestry": "The World Trade Center Tapestry was a large tapestry by Joan Mir\u00f3 and Josep Royo. It was displayed in the lobby of 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower) in New York City from 1974 until it was destroyed in 2001.\nSaul Wenegrat, former director of the art program for the Port Authority of New York, had suggested to Mir\u00f3 that he could make a tapestry for the World Trade Center, but the artist declined as he would only make the work with his own hands but had no experience of making a tapestry."}}
