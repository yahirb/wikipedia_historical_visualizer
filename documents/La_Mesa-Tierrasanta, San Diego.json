{"La_Mesa": {"Tierrasanta, San Diego": "Tierrasanta, Spanish for \"holy land,\" or \"holy ground\", is a community within the city of San Diego, California. The symbol of Tierrasanta is an encircled Conquistador cross, similar to one atop Montserrat (mountain) near Barcelona, Spain, though it no longer holds any religious meaning. The community is referred to as \"The Island in the Hills\" by locals and on welcome signs."}}
