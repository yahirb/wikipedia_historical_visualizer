{"McAllen": {"McAllen, Texas": "McAllen is the largest city in Hidalgo County, Texas, United States, and the twenty-second most populous city in Texas. It is located at the southern tip of the state in the Rio Grande Valley. The city limits extend south to the Rio Grande, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa, and McAllen is approximately 70 miles (110 km) west of the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2010 census the city's population was 129,877, and the population of the McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission metropolitan area was 774,769. As of 2016, the city population was estimated to be 142,212. It is the fifth most populous metropolitan area in the state of Texas, and the bi-national Reynosa\u2013McAllen Metropolitan Area counts a population of nearly 1.5 million.\nFrom its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character. But the latter half of the 20th century saw steady growth, which the metropolitan area still experiences today. The introduction of the maquiladora economy and the North American Free Trade Association led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico."}}
