{"Cranston": {"Reservoir Avenue Sewage Pumping Station": "The Reservoir Avenue Sewage Pumping Station is an historic wastewater pumping facility on the south side of the junction of Reservoir and Pontiac Avenues in southern Providence, Rhode Island. From the street it looks like a single-story brick structure with a hip roof, and metal doorways on its north and east elevations. This building stands atop a substantial concrete substructure, which houses a dry well and wet well."}}
