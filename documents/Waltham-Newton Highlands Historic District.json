{"Waltham": {"Newton Highlands Historic District": "The Newton Highlands Historic District encompasses the historic heart of the village of Newton Highlands in Newton, Massachusetts. When it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, the district extended along Lincoln Street from Woodward to Hartford Streets, and included blocks of Bowdoin, Erie and Hartford Streets south of Lincoln Street. The district was enlarged in 1990 to include the cluster of commercial buildings on Lincoln Street between Hartford and Walnut Streets."}}
