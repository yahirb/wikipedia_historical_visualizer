{"Baltimore": {"One Calvert Plaza": "One Calvert Plaza, formerly the Continental Trust Company Building, is a historic 16-story, 76 m (249 ft) skyscraper in Baltimore, Maryland. The Beaux-Arts, early modern office building was constructed with steel structural members clad with terra cotta fireproofing and tile-arch floors. Its namesake was chartered in 1898 and instrumental in merging several Baltimore light and gas companies into one citywide system (known as the \"Consolidated Gas, Light, Electric Power Company of Baltimore City\" until 1955 when it was shortened and renamed the \"Baltimore Gas and Electric Company\")."}}
