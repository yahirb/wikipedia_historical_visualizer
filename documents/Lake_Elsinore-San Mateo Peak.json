{"Lake_Elsinore": {"San Mateo Peak": "San Mateo Peak is the unofficially named 3,591-foot (1,095 m) peak, at the western end of the ridge running west then northwest from Elsinore Peak to Morrell Canyon, south and west of the Morrell Potrero in the Elsinore Mountains of the Santa Ana Mountain Range. The peak name was given by Sierra Club Lower Peaks Committee Guide, originally named by Ken Croker who for 20 years maintained trails in the Santa Ana Mountains with volunteers from the Sierra Club. It remains officially nameless despite being the highest summit in the Elsinore Mountains, higher than Elsinore Peak, at 3536 ft., the highest named peak in those mountains."}}
