{"Minneapolis": {"Peavey Plaza": "Peavey Plaza is a public outdoor event space in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota at the south end of Nicollet Mall between South 11th and 12th Streets. The sunken plaza and its amphitheater was designed by landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg and built in 1975 alongside Orchestra Hall. The Cultural Landscape Foundation has deemed the plaza a \"marvel of modernism\" and it has been named one of the top ten most endangered historical sites in Minnesota."}}
