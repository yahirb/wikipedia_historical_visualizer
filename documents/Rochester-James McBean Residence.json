{"Rochester": {"James McBean Residence": "The James McBean Residence is a house in Rochester, Minnesota designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. This Usonian house is an example of the second type (Prefab #2) of the Marshall Erdman Prefab Houses. This house and the Walter Rudin House have the same floor plan and vary only in minor details such as paint color and siting, because they are the only 2 Prefab #2 houses in existence."}}
