{"Glendale": {"The Prospect Studios": "The Prospect Studios (also known as ABC Television Center [West]) is a lot containing several television studios located at 4151 Prospect Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the corner of Prospect and Talmadge Street (named in honor of silent screen star Norma Talmadge), just east of Hollywood. For more than 50 years, this facility served as the West Coast headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company before the network moved its main headquarters to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. From 1949 to 1999, ABC-owned Los Angeles television station KABC-TV was also located there."}}
