{"Fremont": {"Rancho Ex-Mission San Jos\u00e9": "Rancho Ex-Mission San Jos\u00e9 was a 30,000-acre (120 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Alameda County, California given in 1846 by Governor Pio Pico to Andr\u00e9s Pico and Juan B. Alvarado. The grant derives its name from the secularized Mission San Jos\u00e9, and was called ex-Mission because of a division made of the lands held in the name of the Mission \u2014 the church retaining the grounds immediately around, and all of the lands outside of this are called ex-Mission lands. The grant extended to the lands of present-day Fremont including the former towns, now districts of Centerville, Irvington and Mission San Jose."}}
