Originally built in 1901, it is currently served by Amtrak, and is planned in the future to become the northern terminus of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor as well as an intermodal station with Richmond's city transit bus services, currently performed by Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC). With uppermost sections located adjacent to the James River Bridge of Interstate 95, it is colloquially known by locals as The Clock Tower."}}
