{"Atlanta": {"Peters Park (Atlanta)": "Peters Park was a planned but never realized neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia, located on the site of today's Georgia Tech campus. Had the neighborhood actually been established in 1884-5, Peters Park would have been Atlanta's first garden suburb, preceding Inman Park, the first to feature winding roads, a lake and a planted boulevard.\n\n\n== Organizers ==\nThe land was owned by Atlanta founder and railroad man Richard Peters, and the \"model suburban town\", as it was called then, was planned by Hannibal Kimball, who was behind the once-iconic Kimball House hotel and the 1881 International Cotton Exposition."}}
