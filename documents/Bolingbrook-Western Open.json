{"Bolingbrook": {"Western Open": "The Western Open was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, first played in September 1899 at the Glen View Club in Golf, Illinois the week preceding the U.S. Open. At the time of its final edition in 2006, it was the third-oldest active PGA Tour tournament, after the British Open (1860) and U.S. Open (1895).\nBeginning in 2007, the Western Open was renamed the BMW Championship, part of the FedEx Cup playoff series, and played with the PGA Tour's point system as the sole qualification standard."}}
