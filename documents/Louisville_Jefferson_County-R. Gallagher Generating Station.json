{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"R. Gallagher Generating Station": "The R. Gallagher Generating Station is a four-unit coal-burning power plant located along the Ohio River some two miles (3 km) downstream from New Albany, Indiana in southernmost Floyd County, Indiana. The total aggregate capacity (year-around) of the plant's four identical units is 560MW. In early 2012, both Units 1 and 3 were retired, due to the lack of pollution controls. Units 2 and 4 continue to operate because Duke Energy installed baghouses, greatly reducing the pollution and meet the current standards set by the EPA. The plant's current output is 280 megawatts (each unit is rated at 140 megawatts)."}}
