{"Davenport": {"Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival": "Leon Bismark \"Bix\" Beiderbecke (March 10, 1903 \u2013 August 6, 1931) was an American jazz cornetist, pianist, and composer.\nWith Louis Armstrong and Muggsy Spanier, Beiderbecke was one of the most influential jazz soloists of the 1920s. His turns on \"Singin' the Blues\" and \"I'm Coming, Virginia\" (both 1927), in particular, demonstrated an unusual purity of tone and a gift for improvisation."}}
