{"Vallejo": {"USS DeLong (DD-129)": "USS DeLong (DD-129) was a Wickes-class destroyer built for the United States Navy during World War I.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Wickes class was an improved and faster version of the preceding Caldwell-class. Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s."}}
