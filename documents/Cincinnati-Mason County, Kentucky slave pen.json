{"Cincinnati": {"Mason County, Kentucky slave pen": "The Mason County, Kentucky slave pen played a very important role in the American slave trade, confining slaves who were intended to go farther south for sale. This slave pen was recovered from a farm in Mason County, Kentucky, United States, which was owned by a slave trader named John W. Anderson, who played a significant part within the American domestic slave trade. Anderson bought his farmstead in 1825, and after several years he and his family built a mansion and converted the old house into slave quarters."}}
