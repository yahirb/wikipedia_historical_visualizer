The district, originally bounded by Rogers, South Greenwood, and South 31st Streets and Dodson Avenue, was developed out of the former estate of William Meade Fishback in the first three decades of the 20th century. Most of the houses built are Colonial or Classical Revival, or Tudor Revival, although the Craftsman style is also well represented."}}
