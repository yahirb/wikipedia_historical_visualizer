{"San_Diego": {"Westfield Horton Plaza": "Westfield Horton Plaza, not to be confused with its adjacent namesake Horton Plaza, is a five-level outdoor shopping mall located in downtown San Diego known for its bright colors, architectural tricks, and odd spatial rhythms. It stands on 6.5 city blocks adjacent to the city's historic Gaslamp Quarter. It was the first successful downtown retail center since the rise of suburban shopping centers decades earlier. The only current anchor store is Macy's. Nordstrom closed in 2016, leaving a vacant anchor store. Other retailers include, Aldo, Forever 21, Johnston and Murphy, Claire's, Gymboree, and Victoria's Secret."}}
