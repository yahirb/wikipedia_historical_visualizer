{"Boca_Raton": {"Pearl City (Boca Raton)": "Pearl City is a neighborhood in Boca Raton, Florida, immediately north of downtown. The neighborhood was originally platted on May 30, 1915 for the blue-collar African Americans employed at the Boca Raton Resort and similar establishments, on area farms, in construction, and various other jobs.\nThere is little evidence on the origin of the name, but it is often theorized that Pearl City was named after the Hawaiian pearl pineapple, a major crop grown in the area at the time."}}
