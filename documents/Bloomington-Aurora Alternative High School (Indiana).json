{"Bloomington": {"Aurora Alternative High School (Indiana)": "Aurora Alternative High School was a high school in Bloomington, Indiana (United States).\nThe Bloomington Graduation School replaced the Aurora Alternative School shortly after it closed. The overlap in services and population essentially amounted to the closing of Aurora and opening of the Graduation School as a rebranding of Aurora, yet with large changes and relocation to a different building."}}
