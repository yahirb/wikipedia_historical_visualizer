{"Boston": {"Government Service Center (Boston)": "The Government Service Center is an unfinished, brutalist structure by architect Paul Rudolph. It is one of the major buildings in the Government Center complex in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, at Cambridge, Staniford, and New Chardon Streets.\nThe building is not consistently known by a single name. Older sources variously call it the Government Service Center (though this name is easily confused with Government Center as a whole), the State Services Center, or the State Health, Welfare and Education Service Center. Many sources, especially contemporary sources, incorrectly use the Hurley or Lindemann names to refer to the whole.\nIn 1962, when the building was still being designed, an act was passed designating the Health, Welfare and Education Service Center as the \"Joseph A. Langone, Jr., Memorial Center\" and calling for the commission to \"erect at a suitable location in said center, a marker, tablet, or other inscription bearing said designation.\" Joseph A. Langone, Jr., was a Massachusetts state senator in the 1930s."}}
