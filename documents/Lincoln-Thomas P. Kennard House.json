{"Lincoln": {"Thomas P. Kennard House": "The Thomas P. Kennard House, also known as the Nebraska Statehood Memorial is the oldest remaining building in the original plat of Lincoln, Nebraska. Built in 1869, the Italianate house belonged to Thomas P. Kennard, the first Secretary of State for Nebraska, and one of three men who picked the Lincoln site for the new state's capital in 1867. The house was designed by architect John Keys Winchell of Chicago.\nIn 1965 the Kennard House was designated the Nebraska Statehood Memorial, and became a museum. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1969.\nThe house is a 2-1/2 story stuccoed brick building with a frame cupola on the shallow-pitched hip roof. The house was extensively altered inside and out before its designation as a memorial and required major restoration work to return its appearance to its original state."}}
