{"Santa_Monica": {"Pacific Jewish Center": "The Pacific Jewish Center, also known as The Shul on the Beach or PJC, is a synagogue in Venice, Los Angeles, California, known for its outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews. The Shul remains the last of the synagogues built in Venice during the first part of the 20th century. Although an Orthodox synagogue, due to its location in an eclectic neighborhood worshippers who identify themselves as many different denominations are all welcomed when attending services and other events."}}
