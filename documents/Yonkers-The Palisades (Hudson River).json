{"Yonkers": {"The Palisades (Hudson River)": "The Palisades, also called the New Jersey Palisades or the Hudson River Palisades, are a line of steep cliffs along the west side of the lower Hudson River in northeastern New Jersey and southeastern New York in the United States. The cliffs stretch north from Jersey City about 20 miles (32 km) to near Nyack, New York and visible at Haverstraw, New York. They rise nearly vertically from near the edge of the river, and are about 300 feet high at Weehawken, increasing gradually to 540 feet high near their northern terminus."}}
