{"Boulder": {"Boulder History Museum": "The Boulder History Museum, now doing business as the Museum of Boulder (operated by the Boulder Historical Society), is a private, nonprofit, local history museum located in Boulder, Colorado, established in 1944 in the historic Harbeck-Bergheim house on University Hill near the University of Colorado Boulder campus. In April 2013, it purchased a second property, the Masonic Lodge building at Broadway and Pine, with the goal of moving its operations to the new building in early 2018.\nIn 2015 the Boettcher Foundation granted the museum $75,000 to renovate the former Masonic Lodge building."}}
