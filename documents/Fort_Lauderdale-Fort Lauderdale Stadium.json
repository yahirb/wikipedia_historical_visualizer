{"Fort_Lauderdale": {"Fort Lauderdale Stadium": "Fort Lauderdale Stadium is a baseball stadium located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida next to Lockhart Stadium. Fort Lauderdale Stadium was most recently leased to Traffic Sports USA (owners of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers) in June 2011.\nThe New York Yankees trained at the stadium between 1962 and 1995. The Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the minor league Florida State League played home games in the stadium from 1962 through 1992. The Fort Lauderdale Red Sox played home games there in 1993, after an unsuccessful attempt to move from Winter Haven to Fort Myers (they ended up the following year in Sarasota). The Baltimore Orioles held Spring Training at the stadium from 1996 to 2009. Memorabilia from the short-lived Fort Lauderdale Red Sox are rare and considered collectors' items. The stadium formerly hosted Federal League Semi-Pro Baseball games throughout the year."}}
