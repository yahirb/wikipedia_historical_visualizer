{"Anchorage": {"Egan Center": "The William A. Egan Civic and Convention Center (commonly known as simply the Egan Center) is a 45,000-square-foot (4,200 m2) convention center located in downtown Anchorage, Alaska at 555 West Fifth Avenue. Constructed in 1984 as part of a massive Anchorage-wide public works project dubbed \"Project 80s\", it replaced the original Z. J. Loussac Library, which opened on the same site in 1955 and was demolished in 1981. The library moved to a new building in midtown Anchorage, also as part of Project 80s."}}
