{"Weymouth_Town": {"Weymouth Civic District": "The Weymouth Civic District is a historic district encompassing the main civic area in Weymouth, Massachusetts. It is anchored by the 1928 Town Hall, which is a slightly reduced-scale replica of the Old State House in Boston, and the Legion Field athletic complex. Most of the houses built in the area along Middle Street between and surrounding these anchors were built between 1850 and 1920."}}
