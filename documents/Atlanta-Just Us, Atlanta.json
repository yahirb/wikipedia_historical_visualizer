{"Atlanta": {"Just Us, Atlanta": "Just Us is the smallest of the official neighborhoods of Atlanta, consisting of only two streets. It began as the \"Fountain Drive-Morris Brown Drive Community Club\" in the late 1940s, and evolved into its present name today during the early 1950s. It was established as the first black owned, constructed sub-division in the city of Atlanta."}}
