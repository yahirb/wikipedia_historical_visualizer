{"Glendale": {"Shade balls": "Shade balls are small plastic spheres floated on top of a reservoir for environmental protection and to slow evaporation. Also known as bird balls, they were developed initially to prevent birds from landing on toxic tailing ponds produced by mining operations. They have been used by airports to prevent birds from being attracted to drainage ponds and thus risking collisions with planes."}}
