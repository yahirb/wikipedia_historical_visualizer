{"Minneapolis": {"McNamara Alumni Center": "The McNamara Alumni Center at the University of Minnesota's Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota is one of the more architecturally striking buildings in the Twin Cities. The building, opened in 2000, contains two main components: University office space and 10 meeting rooms for University and public use. The University owns the land, but the University of Minnesota Gateway Corporation, consisting of the U of M Foundation and U of M Alumni Association, owns the structure."}}
