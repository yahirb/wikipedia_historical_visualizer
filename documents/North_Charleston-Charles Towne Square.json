{"North_Charleston": {"Charles Towne Square": "Charles Towne Square was an indoor shopping mall located in North Charleston, South Carolina opened in 1976 by developer Melvin Simon & Associates. It was most noted for its large \"town square\" style clock and children's train ride during Christmas time. The mall's tenants included original anchors Montgomery Ward, JCPenney and Edward's, a local department store which would later be sold to Kuhn's-Big K and renamed \"Big K-Edwards.\" Big K-Edwards closed and Wilson's Catalog Showrooms moved into the space."}}
