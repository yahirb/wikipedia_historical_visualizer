{"Newton": {"Fisher Hill Reservoir": "The Fisher Hill Reservoir and Gatehouse are a historic element of the public water supply for the Greater Boston area. The reservoir was located on Fisher Road between Hyslop and Channing Roads in Brookline, Massachusetts, and is now the site of Fisher Hill Reservoir Park. It was built in 1886-87 as an early component of the Boston Water Board's expansion of its high service system."}}
