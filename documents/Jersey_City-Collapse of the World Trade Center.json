{"Jersey_City": {"Collapse of the World Trade Center": "The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center (WTC) collapsed on September 11, 2001, as a result of being struck by two jet airliners hijacked by 10 terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda, during the September 11 attacks. Two of the four hijacked airliners crashed into the Twin Towers, one into the North Tower (WTC 1) and the other into the South Tower (WTC 2). The collapse of the Twin Towers destroyed the rest of the complex, and debris from the collapsing towers severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures."}}
