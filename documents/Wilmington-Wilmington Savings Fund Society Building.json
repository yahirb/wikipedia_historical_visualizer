{"Wilmington": {"Wilmington Savings Fund Society Building": "The Wilmington Savings Fund Society Building is a historic bank building at 838 North Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware. The three story masonry structure was built in 1920, replacing an earlier building constructed by the Wilmington Savings Fund Society (WSFS Bank) in 1886, and was designed by the New York City Hoggson Brothers firm. It is a stately expression of the Classical Revival, with massive Egyptian columns supporting porticos on three sides."}}
