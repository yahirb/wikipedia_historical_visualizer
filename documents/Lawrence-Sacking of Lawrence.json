{"Lawrence": {"Sacking of Lawrence": "The Siege of Lawrence occurred on May 21, 1856, when pro-slavery activists, led by Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, attacked and ransacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas, which had been founded by anti-slavery settlers from Massachusetts, who were hoping to make Kansas as a \"free state\". The incident made worse the guerrilla war in Kansas Territory that later became known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nThe human cost of the attack was low: only one person\u2014a member of the pro-slavery gang\u2014was killed, and his death was accidental."}}
