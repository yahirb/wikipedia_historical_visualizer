{"Milpitas": {"Santa Clara station (California)": "The Santa Clara Depot is one of two heavy railway stations in Santa Clara, California (the other being Great America Station further to the north). It is served by the Caltrain from San Francisco, and is served by the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) from Stockton although this service was previously suspended from 2005 until 2012 due to track construction in the area. This station is the planned terminal for the Silicon Valley BART extension into Santa Clara County and will be preceded by Diridon/Arena BART station with direct service to San Francisco/Daly City and Richmond."}}
