{"Springfield": {"Old Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity House (Eugene, Oregon)": "The first Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house in Eugene, Oregon is a 2.5-story building in the craftsman style completed in 1910. The wood-frame, hip roof building was constructed by Eugene blacksmith George Lill and features seven varieties of decorative cement blocks applied to the exterior surface. Lill manufactured the blocks himself by a process meant to simulate fine ashlar stone masonry."}}
