{"Fort_Smith": {"Drennen-Scott House": "The Drennen-Scott House is a historic house museum on North 3rd Street in Van Buren, Arkansas. It is a single-story log structure, finished in clapboards, with a side-gable roof that has a slight bell-cast shape due to the projection of the roof over the front porch that extends across the width of its main block. The house was built in 1836 by John Drennen, one of Van Buren's first settlers."}}
