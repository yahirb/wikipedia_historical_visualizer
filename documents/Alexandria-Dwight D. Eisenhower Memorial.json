{"Alexandria": {"Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial": "The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial is a United States presidential memorial under construction, honoring Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during World War II and the 34th President of the United States. On October 25, 1999, the United States Congress created the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and charged it with creating \"...an appropriate permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower...to perpetuate his memory and his contributions to the United States.\" A preliminary design by architect Frank Gehry proved controversial. After several years of hearings and several design changes, a revised preliminary design won approval from the United States Commission of Fine Arts in the summer of 2013."}}
