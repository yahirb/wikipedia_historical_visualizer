{"Arlington": {"Six Flags Mall": "Six Flags Mall opened in 1970 at 2831 East Division Street (SH 180) and SH 360 in Arlington, Texas, between Fort Worth and Dallas. Arlington's first enclosed shopping center, it was named after the nearby Six Flags Over Texas theme park. A new owner acquired roughly one-third of the mall in December 2012 and announced plans to redevelop it as a Hispanic-oriented shopping mall called \"Plaza Central\" and, after resolving legal issues, reopened in October 2014, but closed again in February 2016."}}
