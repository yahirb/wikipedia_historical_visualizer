{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"Cherokee Gardens, Louisville": "Cherokee Gardens is a residential area six miles east of downtown Louisville, Kentucky USA. The area is a collection of small, unconnected subdivisions along Lexington Road and large estates built just outside Cherokee Park.\nThe area was deeded to James Southall and Richard Charlton for their part in the French and Indian War. The land remained untouched well into the 1850s because it lay off Frankfort Avenue and Bardstown Road, the two major through routes of the area."}}
