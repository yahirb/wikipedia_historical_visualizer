{"Tucson": {"Museum of Contemporary Art, Tucson": "The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Tucson, Arizona, United States, was founded in 1996, by Julia Latane, James Graham, and David Wright, artists and arts advocates. The museum was founded to create a permanent institution for contemporary art in Tucson's arts district that would be immune to the demands of rising real estate prices. The mission of the museum was to create a venue to show the work of Tucson artists to the rest of the world, and to bring the most exciting new artists of the world to Tucson."}}
