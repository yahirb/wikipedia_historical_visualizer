{"Rockville": {"Washington Grove station": "Washington Grove is a passenger rail station in Washington Grove, Maryland, on MARC Train's Brunswick Line. The station serves a historic community near Washington, D.C. that was a summer retreat for many of its citizens during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but that recently have become year-round residences without destroying the outward appearance of the original structures in the community. Originally the rail connection provided the transportation to the community, which is designed only for pedestrian use along footpaths."}}
