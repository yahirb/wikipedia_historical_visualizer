{"Woodbury": {"Serbian Home": "The Serbian Home is a two-story brick building, that was built in 1924 in South Saint Paul in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It was built as a community center for Serbian immigrants who worked in the meatpacking industry. It now serves as a museum respecting the multitude of ethnic groups who have made the city their home."}}
