{"Spokane": {"Riverfront Park Carousel": "The Riverfront Park Carrousel, also known as the Looff Carrousel and the Natatorium Park carousel, is a carrousel in Spokane, Washington, built in 1909 by Charles I. D. Looff as a gift for Looff's daughter Emma Vogel and her husband Louis Vogel, who owned Natatorium Park in Spokane. It remained at the park until 1968 when the park closed. The carousel was relocated to its present location at Riverfront Park in 1975 where it continues to operate."}}
