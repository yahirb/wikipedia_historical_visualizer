{"Lynn": {"Lynn Common Historic District": "The Lynn Common Historic District encompasses the town common of Lynn, Massachusetts and the surrounding buildings which face it. Although its establishment dates to the late 17th century, the area's time of development is predominantly in the 19th century, when the common was transformed into a park. The common is an elongated grassy area, flanked by North and South Common Streets, with a number of small cross streets breaking it into several pieces."}}
