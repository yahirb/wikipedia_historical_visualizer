{"Albuquerque": {"The Pit (arena)": "The Pit, formally named Dreamstyle Arena, is an indoor arena in the southwest United States, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the south end of the city, it primarily serves as the home venue of the University of New Mexico Lobo basketball teams. The facility opened in 1966 as University Arena, but soon gained the nickname \"The Pit\" due to its innovative subterranean design, with the playing floor 37 feet (11 m) below street level."}}
