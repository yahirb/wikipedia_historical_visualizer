{"Miami_Beach": {"Petit Douy": "Petit Douy, or Ch\u00e2teau Petit Douy, is a City of Miami historic property located at 1500 Brickell Avenue in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami, Florida, USA. The two-story Period Revival French Ch\u00e2teau was built in 1931, designed by architect Martin L. Hampton. The then-residential house was nominated for historic designation in 1983 by the City of Miami. The design and name of the house was inspired by a ch\u00e2teau in Douy, France, after its original owners, local attorneys John Murrell and Ethel Murrell, visited that country."}}
