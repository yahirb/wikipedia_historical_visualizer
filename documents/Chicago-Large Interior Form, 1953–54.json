{"Chicago": {"Large Interior Form, 1953\u201354": "Large Interior Form, 1953\u201354 is a sculpture by Henry Moore.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was produced in a bronze edition of six, which was first created as part of a larger work in the 1950s, and only cast as a separate work from 1981 onwards, and catalogued as LH 297b. It began as the interior component of the artist's Large Upright Internal/External Form (LH 297a), but Moore much later decided the piece worked well by itself."}}
