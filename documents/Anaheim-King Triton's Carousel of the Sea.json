{"Anaheim": {"King Triton's Carousel of the Sea": "King Triton's Carousel of the Sea is a carousel at Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The attraction's name comes from King Triton, Ariel's father from The Little Mermaid. Unlike the horse arrangement on the King Arthur Carousel at Disneyland, this ocean-themed carousel uses multi-colored sea creatures like seahorses, flying fish, dolphins, sea lions, sea otters, whales, and garibaldi."}}
