{"Atlanta": {"W275BK": "W275BK is a radio station translator in Decatur, Georgia. Owned by Urban One, the station simulcasts an urban oldies music format branded as Classix 102.9, as a relay from an HD Radio subchannel of WUMJ.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Conflicts ===\nIn 2009, the station was assigned to WWVA-FM 105.7, allowing it to circumvent the prohibition on airing original programming by having it simulcast on an HD Radio channel on WWVA. On April 4, it became hip-hop Streetz 102.9, but went silent a few days later when the person responsible for the new station, the former head of the Radio One Atlanta station group, was sued by Radio One for allegedly using his former position to take the group's intellectual property (including remixes) and violating a non-compete clause.\nThe translator was started by Radio Assist Ministry and was granted a construction permit in late May 2004 as W223AO on 92.5 MHz."}}
