{"Oshkosh": {"First Presbyterian Church (Oshkosh, Wisconsin)": "First Presbyterian Church is a historic church at 110 Church Avenue in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States.\nIt was designed by Walter A. Holbrook of Milwaukee and built in 1893. The style is Richardsonian-Romanesque, with a complex, irregular profusion of turrets, chimneys and towers resembling Richardson's early libraries, meant to suggest it had been gradually added onto over many years."}}
