{"Pomona": {"Cecil the Sagehen": "Cecil Sagehen is the official mascot of Pomona College and Pitzer College in Claremont, California, and serves as the graphic image of Pomona-Pitzer sports. Pomona\u2019s sports teams are called the Sagehens. The college's football team plays its home games in Merritt Field. The nickname \"Sagehen\" first appeared in a 1913 issue of The Student Life, the Pomona student newspaper. One popular myth is that a reporter intended to refer the teams as sage Huns, but accidentally typed \"hens\". However, many say this tale is very unlikely and coincidental because the \"u\" and \"e\" on a keyboard are quite far and Sage Hens actually exist in southern California."}}
