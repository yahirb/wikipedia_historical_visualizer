{"Milpitas": {"Jose Maria Alviso Adobe": "The Jose Maria Alviso Adobe, located in Milpitas, California, United States, was the home of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alviso, an early alcalde (mayor) of neighboring Pueblo de San Jose. It was built in 1837 and enlarged in the early 1850s, and stands as an excellent example of the Monterey Colonial style of architecture popularized throughout California in the 1830s and 1840s. It is the only remaining example of this style in the Santa Clara Valley and San Francisco Bay Area."}}
