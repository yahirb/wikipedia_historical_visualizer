{"Worcester": {"Edward Stone Three-Decker": "The Edward Stone Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 8 Wyman Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1888, during an early phase of development in the area, it originally housed workers at nearby manufacturers, and later housed office workers who went downtown by streetcar. The house was highlighted for its Stick style architectural decorations when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, including elements in the gable end and on the porch."}}
