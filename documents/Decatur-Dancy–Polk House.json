{"Decatur": {"Dancy\u2013Polk House": "The Dancy\u2013Polk House (also known as the Col. Francis Dancy House) is a historic residence in Decatur, Alabama. The house was built in 1829 for Colonel William Francis Dancy, an early settler in the area, who later moved to Franklin, LA. It is the oldest building in Decatur, and one of only four to survive the Civil War (the others being the Old State Bank, the Rhea\u2013McEntire House, and the Todd House in the Bank Street\u2013Old Decatur Historic District)."}}
