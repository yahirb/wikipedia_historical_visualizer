{"Chicopee": {"Longmeadow Street\u2013North Historic District": "The Longmeadow Street\u2013North Historic District encompasses a stretch of Longmeadow Street (US Route 5) in northern Longmeadow, Massachusetts, from the town line with neighboring Springfield to Cooley and Westmoreland Streets in the south. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The district's primarily residential architecture and streetscape is reflective of more than two centuries of development trends, and a late 19th-century desire to maintain a more rural atmosphere."}}
