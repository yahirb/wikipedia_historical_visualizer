{"Cupertino": {"Picchetti Brothers Winery": "The Picchetti Winery, also known as the Picchetti Ranch, is a winery located at 13100 Montebello Rd., Cupertino, California in the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve. The Picchetti brothers, Secondo and Vincenzo, for whom the ranch was named, were among the earliest settlers to plant grapes on this ridge, which they named \"Monte Bello\" or \"beautiful mountain.\" This ridge was later to become one of Santa Clara County's important vineyard areas.\nThe complex is composed of seven buildings built between 1880 and 1920, which retain their original design details."}}
