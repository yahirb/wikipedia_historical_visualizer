{"Trenton": {"Lower Makefield Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania": "Lower Makefield Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA, and is usually referred to as \"Yardley\" due to the prominence of Yardley Borough in that area. However, Yardley Borough is much smaller by both population and land area, and is surrounded by Lower Makefield on three sides (the fourth side being the Delaware River).\nLower Makefield Township is located in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area (also known as the Delaware Valley), and its crime rate is the lowest in the metropolitan area, but it borders several towns in New Jersey to its north and east that are all in the New York Metropolitan Area."}}
