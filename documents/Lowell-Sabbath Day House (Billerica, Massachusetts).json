{"Lowell": {"Sabbath Day House (Billerica, Massachusetts)": "The Sabbath Day House is an historic house located at 20 Andover Road in Billerica, Massachusetts. The main block of the 1.5 story wood frame house was built in the mid-1760s to provide a place for parishioners to warm themselves in between the morning and afternoon services at the adjacent Congregational Church. The house was in that time maintained by a caretaker, and came into private ownership in 1818, when it was no longer needed for its original purpose."}}
