{"Orem": {"Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)": "Bridal Veil Falls is a 607-foot-tall (185 m) double cataract waterfall in the south end of Provo Canyon, close to US189 in Utah, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn aerial tramway service to the top of the falls was built in 1961, and the small, six-passenger tramway functioned as a recreational attraction and as the only access to the mountaintop Eagle's Nest Lodge and restaurant, situated on a cliff at the top of the falls and built by Groneman Construction. When the tramway was in operation prior to the 1996 avalanche, it was heralded as the \"world's steepest aerial tramway,\" although that claim is difficult to ascertain."}}
