{"Chicopee": {"Olmsted-Hixon-Albion Block": "The Olmsted-Hixon-Albion Block is a historic commercial block at 1645-1659 Main Street in the South End of downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. The building is actually three separate buildings that were conjoined by internal connections in 1929. The Olmsted Block (1645-1649 Main Street) was built in 1875 by John C. Olmsted, a leading businessman and banker in the city, and used as an office building."}}
