{"Lincoln": {"Bob Devaney Sports Center": "The Bob Devaney Sports Center is a sports complex on the campus of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States that includes a 7,907-seat multi-purpose arena, a 1,000-seat covered 25-yard swimming and diving facility (Devaney Center Natatorium) and a 5,000-seat covered track and field (athletics) facility (Devaney Sports Center Indoor Track) that features a 200-meter hydraulic-banked track, one of only three in the United States and seven in the world. The arena opened in 1976 and is named after former Nebraska football coach and athletic director Bob Devaney. It is home to the Cornhuskers gymnastics, indoor track and field and swimming and diving teams, and was also home to the school's basketball teams through the 2012\u201313 season. The building largely replaced the Nebraska Coliseum, which was the former home of the volleyball and wrestling teams.\nIt hosted the 1980, 1984 and 1988 men's NCAA basketball tournament Midwest first- and second-round games, and the 1993 women's NCAA tournament first round. In the arena's first 30 years, the men's basketball team never had a losing home schedule.\nPinnacle Bank Arena, a new arena in the Haymarket district of Lincoln that opened in August 2013, replaced the Devaney Center for the basketball teams in the fall of 2013. The main arena was then downsized from 13,595 seats to 7,907 seats, and became the new home of the volleyball team.\nThe Bob Devaney Sports Center actually opened in March 1976 when it was used for the Nebraska Boys State Basketball Tournament. The Nebraska Cornhuskers decided to wait to the beginning of the next season because they wanted the home advantage of the old Coliseum.\nDespite Nebraska's men's and women's basketball teams moving out of the Bob Devaney Sports Center, the arena will continue to host games for the Nebraska Boys and Girls State Basketball Tournaments."}}
