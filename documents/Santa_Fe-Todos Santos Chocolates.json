{"Santa_Fe": {"Todos Santos Chocolates": "Todos Santos (All Saints in Spanish) is a chocolate shop opened by Hayward Simoneaux in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1999. He began shaping his confections in the shape of Milagros, \"small charmlike silver and gold offerings made to saints\" in traditional Hispanic cultures, using custom molds and coatings of silver and gold leaf. Simoneaux's skills with the materials were refined as a fine art framer."}}
