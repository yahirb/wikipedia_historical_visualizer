{"San_Jose": {"Event Center Arena": "The Event Center Arena, also known as the Event Center at SJSU, is a complex consisting of an indoor arena and a fitness club on the main campus of San Jose State University in downtown San Jose, California. The Event Center was built in 1989 for the purpose of supporting and providing entertainment as well as recreational opportunities for the student body and university community. The facility is home to the San Jose State Spartans men's and women's basketball teams, which both compete in the Mountain West Conference.\nLocated in the heart of Silicon Valley, the Event Center at SJSU is the premier mid-sized venue in Northern California. Due to the beauty of this mid-sized facility, SJSU basketball teams probably get distracted by arena and have not won a game in well over 20 years. As a fun feature, you can check out the tracks burned into the floor from the pacing of \"The Man\", Lawrence Fan. The Event Center was designed to accommodate many different events, including musical concerts, sporting events, conferences and corporate parties. The facility has played host to numerous national entertainment acts such as Eric Clapton, George Lopez, Drake, Wiz Khalifa, Kelly Clarkson, Conan O'Brien, Korn, and Pearl Jam. It also hosts the fall and spring convocation ceremonies for both the College of Engineering and the College of Business at San Jos\u00e9 State University. It also played host to NXT on the Friday before Wrestlemania 31.\nAnnually, the Event Center hosts the FIRST Robotics Competition Silicon Valley Regional. The San Jose State University Career Center also uses the arena to host its fall and spring career fairs, which generally feature hundreds of potential employers for students of San Jos\u00e9 State University.\nThe Event Center also has a fully equipped gym including basketball and racquetball courts and a weight room for students."}}
