{"New_York": {"359 Broadway": "The building at 359 Broadway between Leonard and Franklin Streets in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City was built in 1852 and was designed by the firm of Field & Correja in the Italianate style.\nThe top three floors of the building were used by pioneering photographer Mathew Brady as a portrait studio from 1853 to 1859, where he photographed many famous Americans. On the south side of the building a faded painted sign for Mathew Brady's Studio could once be seen by pedestrians on Broadway, but this was painted over before the building was landmarked.\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark in 1990, an action which was confirmed in 1992 after a long battle between the city and its owner. Justice Karla Moskowitz of the New York State Supreme Court decided in April that it was \"clear that the building was considered from the first on architectural as well as historical grounds.\" The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had argued for the building's preservation, both because of its famous tenant \u2013 Brady \u2013 and the fact that each of the building's five floors had received a distinctive window treatment, thus indicating that it was an architecturally significant structure and not merely a utilitarian structure."}}
