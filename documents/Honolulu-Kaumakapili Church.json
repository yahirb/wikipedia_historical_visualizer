{"Honolulu": {"Kaumakapili Church": "Kaumakapili Church is a Gothic Revival church located at 766 North King Street in the Kap\u0101lama neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. It was originally established on April 1, 1838 at the corner of Smith and Beretania Streets as a Protestant church for common people; the only existing church, the Kawaiahao Church, was attended by nobility. A new brick and wood frame church building with two steeples was built for the church from 1881 to 1888; however, that building was burned along with large areas of Chinatown in an attempt to control an outbreak of bubonic plague."}}
