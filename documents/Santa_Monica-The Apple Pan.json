{"Santa_Monica": {"The Apple Pan": "The Apple Pan is a restaurant (opened in 1947) locally famous for its hamburgers, apple pies served with vanilla ice cream, and banana cream pie.\nIn addition to being one of Los Angeles\u2019 oldest continuing operating restaurants, The Apple Pan is notable as the basis for the popular Johnny Rockets chain of restaurants. Johnny Rockets founder Ronn Teitlebaum claimed he used The Apple Pan as a model for his successful 1950s-themed franchise, copying the menu, presentation, counter seating and grilling area for the Johnny Rockets chain based on this original restaurant: a small menu with few items, hamburgers served wrapped in paper and on cardboard plates, hamburgers grilled-to-order in full view of the counter-seated customers."}}
