{"New_York": {"Pace University": "Pace University is a private institution that was founded in 1906. It has a campus in Manhattan, New York City, and two campuses in Westchester County, New York, in Pleasantville and White Plains. The school also operates other properties, including a women's justice center in nearby Yonkers, city public school Pace University High School, and two business incubators.\nPace University was founded by brothers Homer St. Clair Pace and Charles A. Pace in 1906, initially as a business school for men and women. It operated out of the New York Tribune Building in New York City, and spread as Pace Institute, operating in major U.S. cities. In the 1920s, the school divested the other facilities, maintaining its Lower Manhattan location. It purchased its first permanent home there in 1951, and opened its Pleasantville campus in 1963. Pace opened its largest building, 1 Pace Plaza, in 1969. Four years later, it became a university. Its White Plains campus opened in 1975 upon Pace's merger with the College of White Plains. Briarcliff College was purchased two years later. In 1994, Pace moved its law school to the White Plains campus, consolidating Westchester undergraduate programs between Pleasantville and Briarcliff. In 1997, Pace purchased the World Trade Institute at One World Trade Center. The school put the Briarcliff campus up for sale in 2015."}}
