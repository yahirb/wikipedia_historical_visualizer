{"North_Charleston": {"Johnson Hagood Stadium": "Johnson Hagood Stadium, is an 11,500-seat football stadium, the home field of The Citadel Bulldogs, in Charleston, South Carolina, USA. The stadium is named in honor of Brigadier General Johnson Hagood, CSA, class of 1847, who commanded Confederate forces in Charleston during the Civil War and later served as Comptroller and Governor of South Carolina.\n\n\n== Original stadium ==\nWhen the condition of the existing College Park Stadium (located in the northeast corner of Hampton Park) became so poor as to be unservicable, the city of Charleston chose to construct a new sports stadium just south of the new campus of The Citadel, on Hagood Avenue. The new stadium was opened October 15, 1927, with a football game between The Citadel and Oglethorpe."}}
