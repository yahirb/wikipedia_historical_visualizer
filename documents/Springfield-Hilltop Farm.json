{"Springfield": {"Hilltop Farm": "Hilltop Farm is a historic country estate and gentleman's farm on Mapleton Avenue in northern Suffield, Connecticut. It was established in 1913 by George M. Hendee, one of the founders of the Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company, one of the nation's first motorcycle makers. Although its manor house was demolished in 1961, the estate retains many buildings built for Hendee, as well as a cluster of older farm buildings that he retained."}}
