{"Springdale": {"Beasley Homestead": "The Beasley Homestead is a historic house and farmstead on United States Route 71 in Bethel Heights, Arkansas. The main house, a Bungalow-style single-story structure built in 1927, is of a type common to Benton County in the 1920s. The outbuildings of the farmstead, including a barn, machine shed, and chicken house, were clearly built at the same time and with similar detailing."}}
