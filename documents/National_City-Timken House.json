{"National_City": {"Timken House": "This Queen Anne Victorian was built in 1888 and was the last residence of inventor Henry Timken (1831-1909). Henry Timken's nieces, the Putnam sisters, played a large role in bringing the fine arts to San Diego. They were major benefactors of the Timken Museum of Art in Balboa Park, a short distance from the home."}}
