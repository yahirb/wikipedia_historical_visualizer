{"North_Charleston": {"Grimke-Fraser Tenements": "The Grimke-Fraser Tenements were built in about 1762 on land that Frederic Grimke purchased in 1747. The thick brick wall that divides the house into two halves and which projects through the roof is evidence of the house's early use as a rental property made of two side-by-side units.\nThe property includes a separate kitchen house in the rear which is perhaps as old as the main house."}}
