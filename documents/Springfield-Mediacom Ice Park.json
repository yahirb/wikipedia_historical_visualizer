{"Springfield": {"Mediacom Ice Park": "Mediacom Ice Park is a multi-purpose arena located in downtown Springfield, Missouri. The arena is owned and operated by the Springfield-Greene County Park Board and serves as a location for community recreation and the home for the Missouri State Ice Bears ice hockey team, Springfield Express junior hockey team, and various youth sports programs. The arena opened in 2001 and was previously known as the Jordan Valley Ice Park; its current name is due to a $200,000 a year, 10-year naming rights agreement with Mediacom, a cable television and communications provider in the United States."}}
