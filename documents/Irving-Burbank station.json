{"Irving": {"Burbank station": "Burbank station is a DART light rail station located near Dallas Love Field airport for service on the Green Line and Orange Line. The station opened as part of the Green Line's expansion in December 2010, and serves the headquarters for Southwest Airlines and an adjacent residential neighborhood.\nThis station was originally proposed to serve the airport terminal directly with an underground station (much like DART's Cityplace Station), but a 2004 study showed that cost would be well beyond acceptable levels and jeopardize a federal grant. The City of Dallas officials and transit agency agreed to a nearby surface-level station on March 12, 2007. Because of this, the station was originally known as Love Field Station during construction. In 2010 Inwood/Love Field Station was designated for bus service to the airport.\nSignage at the station still purports a future connection to Love Field."}}
