{"Revere": {"Pine Banks": "Pine Banks is a 107.5-acre (0.435 km2) park located in the cities of Malden and Melrose, Massachusetts. It was donated by former Mayor of Malden Elisha S. Converse to be used \"forever as a public park\". The agreement was that both towns had equal ownership, responsibility, and power, which is still the case today; the non\u2013profit Board of Trustees owns the park, with equal representation from both cities."}}
