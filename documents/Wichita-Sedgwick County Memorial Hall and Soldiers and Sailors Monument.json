{"Wichita": {"Sedgwick County Memorial Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Monument": "Sedgwick County Memorial Hall and Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1911\u201313) is a Civil War monument on the grounds of the Old Sedgwick County Courthouse, in Wichita, Kansas. It was designed by E. M. Viquesney, with sculpture by Frederick Hibbard and the W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company. The idea to construct a memorial to Sedgewick County Civil War veterans began with two local GAR posts in 1904, but sufficient funds were not available until in 1911."}}
