{"Fayetteville": {"Wilson-Pittman-Campbell-Gregory House": "The Wilson-Pittman-Campbell-Gregory House is a historic house at 405 East Dickson Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick structure, with a late 19th-century two-story kitchen addition to the rear, and a modern single-story ell. Its current west-facing front dates stylistically to the 1870s, with Italianate brackets, engaged posts, and balustrade, but is a 1930s reconstruction of the original."}}
