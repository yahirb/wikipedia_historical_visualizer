{"Richmond": {"Hull Street Station": "Hull Street Station was a railroad station in the city of Richmond, Virginia. It was built by the Southern Railway to replace Mill Street Station across the river in Richmond. The station, which had been closed, was damaged in several floods of the James River before Richmond's flood wall was completed in 1995."}}
