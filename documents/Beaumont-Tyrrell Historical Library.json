{"Beaumont": {"Tyrrell Historical Library": "The Tyrrell Historical Library is a public library in Beaumont, Texas. Originally built in 1903 to serve as the First Baptist Church, the building displays a mix of Richardsonian Romanesque and Victorian Gothic architectures, with pointed arch windows and quatrefoils, and all of its original stained glass. The building became vacant in 1923 when the congregation moved to a new location."}}
