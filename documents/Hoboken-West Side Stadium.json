{"Hoboken": {"West Side Stadium": "The West Side Stadium (also known as the New York Sports and Convention Center) was a proposed football and Olympic stadium to be built on a platform over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.\nThe stadium would have been an all-weather facility with a retractable roof, allowing it to be used as either a 200,000 square feet (18,600 m2) indoor convention hall, or an 85,000 seat (75,000 post-Olympics) indoor/outdoor sporting event stadium. It was to be the new home for the New York Jets of the National Football League, who at the time of the proposal played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey and were junior tenants to the New York Giants."}}
