It was a four-story brick building, with Classical Revival and Romanesque/Tuscan Mediterranean influence, built in 1896 to a design by the local architectural firm of Cutting, Carleton & Cutting. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, at which time it stood alone on its block, the surrounding buildings having been demolished by urban renewal activities."}}
