{"Long_Beach": {"DisneySea (California)": "DisneySea was a proposed amusement park designed by Disney that was planned to open at the proposed Port Disney complex in Long Beach, California. Port Disney was part of the \"Disney Decade\" plan of expansion in the 1990s, and was competing with the WestCOT proposal to add a \"second gate\" to the Disneyland Resort complex in Anaheim, California. The \"second gate\" was eventually built on the site of the former Disneyland parking lot as Disney California Adventure."}}
