{"Fontana": {"Stringfellow Acid Pits": "The Stringfellow Acid Pits are a toxic waste dump, and a Superfund site, located in Riverside County, California, United States, just north of the neighborhood of Glen Avon, California. The site became the center of national news coverage in the early 1980s, in part because it was considered one of the most polluted sites in California, and because it became linked with mismanagement and scandal in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSituated at the base of the Jurupa Mountains in Pyrite Canyon, the 17-acre (69,000 m2) site was originally a rock quarry owned by James Stringfellow."}}
