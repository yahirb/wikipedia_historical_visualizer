{"Little_Rock": {"Waterside Street Bridge": "The Waterside Street Bridge is a historic bridge, carrying Waterside Street across an inlet of Lake Number 1 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a rustic closed-spandrel masonry structure, with an exterior of rough uncoursed fieldstone that rises to parapet above the side of the roadbed. It is one of four masonry bridges built between 1929 and 1939 by developer Justin Matthews as part of the Lakewood subdivision."}}
