{"Worcester": {"Rodney Davis Three-Decker": "The Rodney Davis Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 62 Catharine Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built in 1894, and features a typical sidehall plan with projecting side section, and a single story porch flanked on one side by a polygonal bay. The build once had more elaborate Queen Anne porch decorations, but these have been lost."}}
