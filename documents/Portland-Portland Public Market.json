{"Portland": {"Portland Public Market": "The Portland Public Market was a public market in Portland, Oregon, United States, built in 1933 at a widely advertised cost of $1 million. Controversial and ambitious, it was never as successful as the Carroll Public Market, centered at southwest Fifth and Yamhill Streets, which it was intended to replace.\nThree stories tall with eleven-story towers, three blocks long, and with features including a gas station, rooftop parking, and a 500-seat auditorium, it was primarily a novelty, and struggled to retain tenants until finally closing in 1942."}}
