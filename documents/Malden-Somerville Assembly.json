{"Malden": {"Somerville Assembly": "The Somerville Assembly was a Ford Motor Company factory in Somerville, Massachusetts which opened in 1926 as a replacement to the Cambridge Assembly. Following the failure of the Edsel, the plant, which had been one of the region\u2019s largest employers, closed its doors in 1958. At that time it was the Edsel division's only Edsel-only assembly line as all other Edsel plants were shared with Mercury or Ford."}}
