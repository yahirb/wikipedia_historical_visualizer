{"Richardson": {"Heritage Farmstead Museum": "Heritage Farmstead Museum (also known as the Ammie Wilson House) is a historic farm museum at 1900 West 15th Street in Plano, Texas.\nThe late-Victorian farm-house was built in 1891 on a 365-acre farm belonging to Mary Alice Farrell and her husband Hunter Farrell, a landowner and businessman whose family had moved to Texas from Virginia. The Farrells divorced in 1929 and eventually their daughter Ammie took over management of the farm and became an award-winning livestock breeder before her death in 1972."}}
