It would have been second tallest building in North America after the Willis Tower in Chicago. With an estimated construction cost of $350\u2013400 million, the project was cancelled before construction commenced, due to lack of funds during the economic downturn.\nThe design created by architect Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn, Inc.
