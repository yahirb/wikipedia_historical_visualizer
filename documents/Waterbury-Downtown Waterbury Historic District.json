It is a roughly rectangular area centered on West Main Street and Waterbury Green, the remnant of the original town commons, which has been called \"one of the most attractive downtown parks in New England.\"\nThe Green was the city's first center, with the buildings around it representing all types of uses, from residences to churches to public buildings. Many early buildings were cleared as the city grew and industrialized."}}
