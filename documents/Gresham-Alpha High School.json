{"Gresham": {"Alpha High School": "Alpha High School was a public alternative high school in Gresham, Oregon, United States. It specialized in school-to-work transition programs. It closed in 2015 due to reduced enrollment; declining demand resulted especially from improved programs at the Gresham-Barlow School District reducing student expulsions and the requirement for the alternative high school."}}
