{"Bartlett": {"U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships": "The U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships was a professional tennis tournament that was last held at the Racquet Club of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The event was played on indoor hard courts and usually took place in February. For much of its more than 100-year history it was a combined men's and women's tournament but in 2014 only a men's tournament was organized."}}
