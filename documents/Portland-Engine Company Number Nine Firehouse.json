{"Portland": {"Engine Company Number Nine Firehouse": "Engine Company Number Nine Firehouse, also known as the Arbor Street Firehouse, is an historic former firehouse at 17 Arbor street in the North Deering neighborhood of Portland, Maine. It was constructed in 1902-03, shortly after Deering was annexed to Portland. It was built to reflect Portland's commitment to the newly annexed suburb as well as due to the city's switch to a paid fire department."}}
