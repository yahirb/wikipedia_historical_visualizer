{"Stamford": {"Trump Parc Stamford": "Trump Parc Stamford is a 34-story condominium property named after Donald Trump and located at 1 Broad Street in Stamford, Connecticut. Real estate developers Thomas Rich and Louis R. Cappelli began planning the project as Park Tower in February 2006; it was renamed after Trump joined the project later that year. The project was initially rejected by the city, as it was considered too large for its 0.5-acre (0.20 ha) site.\nA revised smaller version of the project was approved in November 2006, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in May 2007. Construction was delayed twice in 2008, after several construction incidents. Trump Parc opened in September 2009 as the tallest building in Stamford.\nIn 2015, during Trump's presidential campaign, Muslim groups in Stamford launched an unsuccessful attempt to have his name removed from the building after he proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a response to recent terrorist attacks conducted by people of the religion."}}
