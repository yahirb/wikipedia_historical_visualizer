{"North_Charleston": {"City Market (Charleston, South Carolina)": "The City Market, or Centre Market, is a historic market complex in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. Established in the 1790s, the market stretches for four city blocks from the architecturally-significant Market Hall, which faces Meeting Street, through a continuous series of one-story market sheds, the last of which terminates at East Bay Street. The Market Hall has been described as a building of the \"highest architectural design quality.\" The entire complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Market Hall and Sheds and was further designated a National Historic Landmark."}}
