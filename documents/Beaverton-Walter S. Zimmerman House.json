{"Beaverton": {"Walter S. Zimmerman House": "The Walter S. Zimmerman House is a historic house located in Portland, Oregon, United States. The Portland architect Wade Hampton Pipes (1877\u20131961) was the most prominent advocate of the English Arts and Crafts movement in Oregon, and established a wide, exclusively residential, body of work in the English Cottage style during his active career (beginning 1911). This 1931 house, designed for the logging and railway businessman Walter Zimmerman, represents a transitional step in the evolution of Pipes's work, moving from traditional stucco walls to brick and adding other Modern details."}}
