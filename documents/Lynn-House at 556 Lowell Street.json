{"Lynn": {"House at 556 Lowell Street": "The House at 556 Lowell Street in Wakefield, Massachusetts is a high style Queen Anne Victorian in the Montrose section of town. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in 1894, probably for Denis Lyons, a Boston wine merchant. The house is asymmetrically massed, with a three story turret topped by an eightsided dome roof on the left side, and a single story porch that wraps partially onto the right side, with a small gable over the stairs to the front door."}}
