{"Richmond": {"Parchester Village, Richmond, California": "Parchester Village is a master planned neighborhood majority African-American village in Northwestern Richmond, California that was the first in the state to sell to blacks.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter World War II temporary housing was torn down in Richmond, many black residents were not allowed to move into what was left. This culminated in the efforts of Reverend Guthrie John Williams, who in 1949 cut a deal that exchanged support for council member Amos Hinkley for more black housing."}}
