{"Atlanta": {"Ponce de Leon Avenue": "Ponce de Leon Avenue ( PONS d\u0259 LEE-\u0259n), often simply called Ponce, provides a link between Atlanta, Decatur, Clarkston, and Stone Mountain, Georgia. It was named for Ponce de Leon Springs, in turn from explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, but is not pronounced as in Spanish. Several grand and historic buildings are located on the avenue."}}
