The garden, at 86 acres (35 ha), is a non-profit organization dedicated to California native plants. The facility was open to the public with free admission for 58 years; in 2009 an admission fee was implemented.\nThe garden originated in 1927 when Susanna Bixby Bryant established a native garden on her rancho in Orange County. The garden relocated to Claremont in 1951. The garden now contains some 70,000 native Californian plants, representing 2,000 native species, hybrids and cultivars.\nThe garden has an active research department, specializing in systematic botany and floristics. The combined herbarium of the garden and neighboring Pomona College holds over 1,200,000 specimens. The journal Aliso is published by the organization semiannually. The garden offers graduate degrees in botany through Claremont Graduate University.\n\n"}}
