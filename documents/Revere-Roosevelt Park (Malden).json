{"Revere": {"Roosevelt Park (Malden)": "Roosevelt Park was a large open public park in Malden, Massachusetts with three baseball diamonds, open space for football games, a basketball court, a children's playground, and an old field house that had closed prior to the closing of the park itself. The park was also the home field for Malden Catholic High School's football program until the completion of their own stadium, Brother Gilbert Stadium, in 1988. The city of Malden announced plans in the mid-1990s to replace all of the public elementary schools in the city."}}
