{"Albuquerque": {"Newlander Apartments": "The Newlander Apartments are a historic apartment building in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Originally built as a single-family house around 1910 and expanded via a number of additions, it is notable as a well-preserved example of the small boarding houses and apartment buildings that housed much of Albuquerque's working-class population in the early 20th century. The building is listed in the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places."}}
