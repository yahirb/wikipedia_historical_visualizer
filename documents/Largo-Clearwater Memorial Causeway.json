{"Largo": {"Clearwater Memorial Causeway": "The Clearwater Memorial Causeway is a four-lane road between downtown Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, Florida, and includes a fixed-span bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway. It carries the State Road 60 designation and is known for its greenways and pedestrian walkways (and was designated as Great Florida Birding Trail several years ago) and elegant bridge appearance and structure. The road is also a major evacuation route during hurricane season."}}
