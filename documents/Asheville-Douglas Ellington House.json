{"Asheville": {"Douglas Ellington House": "Douglas Ellington House is a historic home located at Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina. It was built in 1926 by architect Douglas Ellington, and is an eclectic stone and brick cottage set into its terraced, hillside site. It consists of a two-bay, 1 1/2-story brick \"cottage\" under a broad-eaved, wood shingled hip roof; a five-bay, uncoursed stone central block; and a traditional, single-room log cabin, said to have been on the property when Ellington bought it and thought to be over 100 years old."}}
