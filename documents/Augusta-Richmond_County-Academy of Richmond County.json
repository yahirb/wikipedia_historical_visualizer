{"Augusta-Richmond_County": {"Academy of Richmond County": "The Academy of Richmond County is a high school located in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Known previously as Richmond County Military Academy, it is commonly known as Richmond Academy or ARC.\nChartered in 1783, it claims to be the fifth oldest existing public high school in the United States, and the oldest existing public high school in the Southern United States. But it did not become a public high school until the second half of the 20th century, so some education historians dispute these claims."}}
