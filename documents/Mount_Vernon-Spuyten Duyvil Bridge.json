{"Mount_Vernon": {"Spuyten Duyvil Bridge": "The Spuyten Duyvil Bridge is a railroad swing bridge that spans the Spuyten Duyvil Creek between Manhattan and the Bronx, in New York City. The bridge, which carries Amtrak trains traveling along the Empire Corridor, is located at the northern tip of Manhattan where the Spuyten Duyvil Creek meets the Hudson River, approximately 1,000 feet (300 m) to the west of the Henry Hudson Bridge. It was built to carry two tracks but now carries only a single track on the east side of the bridge."}}
