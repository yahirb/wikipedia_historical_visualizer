{"Boston": {"Boston Common and Public Garden": "The Boston Common and Public Garden are a pair of public parks in Boston, Massachusetts. Boston Common, established 1634, is one of the oldest public spaces in the nation, and the adjacent Boston Public Garden is a more manicured garden space which was established in 1837 on marshland that was filled in. The two were listed as a single entry on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972."}}
