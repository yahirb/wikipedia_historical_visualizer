{"Beaumont": {"Edison Plaza": "The Edison Plaza is a 17-story office building in downtown Beaumont, Texas, located at 350 Pine St. The building is downtown's newest and tallest skyscraper. Originally built by Gulf States Utilities as its headquarters, it serves as the Texas headquarters for its successor, Entergy, Texas; however, Entergy no longer owns the building and leases four floors only out of the 17 in the building."}}
