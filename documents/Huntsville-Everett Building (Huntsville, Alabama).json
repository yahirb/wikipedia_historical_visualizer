{"Huntsville": {"Everett Building (Huntsville, Alabama)": "The Everett Building is a historic commercial building in Huntsville, Alabama. Built in 1899, it represents the Commercial Brick style of the late 1800s and early 1900s that eschewed the applied decoration of the Victorian style. The two-story building is divided into five storefronts, although only the southernmost two have entrances today."}}
