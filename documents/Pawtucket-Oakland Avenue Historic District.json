{"Pawtucket": {"Oakland Avenue Historic District": "The Oakland Avenue Historic District is a residential historic district in the Smith Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, USA. The area is a densely built stretch of Oakland and Pembroke Avenues, extending from Eaton Street in the north to about half-way between Chad Brown Street and Smith Street in the south. Only buildings on the east side of Pembroke are included, while both sides of Oakland Avenue are, as are a few properties on adjacent roads. All but two of the 110 buildings in the district are residential, and are set on small lots of similar size."}}
