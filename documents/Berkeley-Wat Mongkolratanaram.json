{"Berkeley": {"Wat Mongkolratanaram": "For the Thai temple in Tampa, see Wat Mongkolratanaram, Tampa\n Wat Mongkolratanaram (Thai: \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21) is a small Thai Buddhist temple located in Berkeley, California. A wat, it mainly attracts Thai American Buddhists, including many who are students at the University of California, Berkeley, but it also draws in many local, non-Buddhists who come searching for the authentic Thai food public brunch on Sundays or attend its frequent cultural events. The temple is home to a Thai school for San Francisco Bay Area youth, as well as Berkeley's Thai Cultural Center."}}
