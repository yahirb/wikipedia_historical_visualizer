{"Phoenix": {"Professional Building (Phoenix, Arizona)": "The Professional Building in Phoenix, Arizona, is an Art Deco skyscraper. Built in 1932, it is 171 feet (52 meters) tall. Angles and setbacks are played up in this streamlined Art Deco design. A central tower rises from the two-story base with a wing on the western side of the building. The entrances on Central Avenue and Monroe Street feature decorative grills above the doors.\nIt functioned as an office building from 1932 until losing its last tenants in the 1990s. The building subsequently sat empty for two decades, before reopening as a hotel in 2015."}}
