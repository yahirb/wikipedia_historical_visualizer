{"Newton": {"Peabody-Williams House": "George Peabody ( PEE-b\u0259-dee; February 18, 1795 \u2013 November 4, 1869) was an American-British financier widely regarded as the \"father of modern philanthropy.\"\nBorn into a poor family in Massachusetts, Peabody went into business in dry goods and later in banking. In 1837, he moved to London, then the capital of world finance, where he became the most noted American banker and helped to establish the young country's international credit. Having no son of his own to whom to pass on his business, Peabody took on Junius Spencer Morgan as a partner in 1854, and their joint business would go on to become J.P. Morgan & Co."}}
