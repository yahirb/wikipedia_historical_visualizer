Its first broadcast came on April 18, 1971 (the 65th anniversary of the Great earthquake), making KZST \"the first FM station between here (the San Francisco Bay Area) and Portland, Oregon.\"\nFounded by Gordon Zlot, KZST remains under the ownership of his company, Redwood Empire Stereocasters. The station plays adult contemporary music, with a family-friendly format aimed at so-called soccer moms who often listen to the radio with their children present. During the holiday season, KZST plays Christmas music. (late November - Christmas Day)\nBrent Farris has broadcast his weekday \"Morning Showgram\" for more than 25 years, the longest current tenure of any radio host in Sonoma County.
