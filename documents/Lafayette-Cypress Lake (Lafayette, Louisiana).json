Today it is a unique university landmark that is a habitat for native irises, alligators, turtles, birds and fish, as well as a hangout for students and a point of interest for tourists visiting Lafayette, Louisiana. Cypress Lake is casually called \"The Swamp,\" which is also the nickname of the Louisiana\u2013Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns stadium, named Cajun Field."}}
