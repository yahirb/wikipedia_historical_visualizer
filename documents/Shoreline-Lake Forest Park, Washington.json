{"Shoreline": {"Lake Forest Park, Washington": "Lake Forest Park is a city in King County, Washington, United States, just north of Seattle. A bedroom community by design, most of the city consists of single-family housing on medium to large-sized lots. Less than 4% of the city land is zoned commercial; most of that is in one location, and there are no industrial areas."}}
