{"Lewisville": {"Trinity Mills, Texas": "Trinity Mills was a small community originally settled in 1853 on land that is today part of the city of Carrollton in northwest Dallas County, Texas (USA).\nThe community was on A. W. Perry's land grant and was named for a gristmill owned by him and Wade H. Witt. The actual gristmill was powered by oxen on a treadwheel and housed in a late-1840s two-story rock structure built on Farmers Creek, 2 miles (3 km) northwest of Carrollton."}}
