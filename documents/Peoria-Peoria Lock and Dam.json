{"Peoria": {"Peoria Lock and Dam": "The Peoria Lock and Dam is a historic lock and dam complex on the Illinois River at Creve Coeur, Illinois. The complex was built in 1938-39 as part of an effort to make the river navigable and establish a route for barges between Chicago and the Mississippi River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers designed the complex; their influence is particularly evident in the dam's control station, as the State of Illinois designed most other dam control stations along the river."}}
