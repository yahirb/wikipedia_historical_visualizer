{"Green_Bay": {"WDUZ": "WDUZ (1400 AM) and WDUZ-FM (107.5 FM) are radio stations serving the Green Bay, Wisconsin area, simulcasting a Sports Talk format as \"Sports Radio 107.5 and 1400 The Fan.\" The stations were owned by Clear Channel Communications, though they were still operated by their previous owner, Cumulus Media, who swapped ownership of both stations (and 3 other Green Bay signals) to Clear Channel in exchange for 2 Ohio stations in early 2009. In August 2013, Clear Channel reached a deal to sell its Green Bay stations back to Cumulus. The sale was consummated on December 31, 2013 at a price of $17,636,643."}}
