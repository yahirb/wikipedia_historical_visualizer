{"Huntington_Park": {"Velaslavasay Panorama": "The Velaslavasay Panorama is an artistic, film, and performance venue in Los Angeles, California, featuring the only painted, 360-degree Arctic panorama created in the United States since the nineteenth century. The panorama was originally established by artist Sara Velas in 2000 at the Tswuun-Tswuun Rotunda building at 5553 Hollywood Boulevard in a cylindrical structure which had formerly housed the Chu Chu Chinese Restaurant. In 2004, its original venue threatened with demolition, the panorama moved to its present location at 1122 W. 24th Street, the former Union Theatre in the University Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles."}}
