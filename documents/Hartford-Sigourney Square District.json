{"Hartford": {"Sigourney Square District": "The Signourney Square Historic District encompasses a neighborhood in the Asylum Hill area of Hartford, Connecticut, that was almost entirely built out in an single decade at the end of the 19th century as a middle-class residential area. It is roughly bounded by Garden, Ashley, and Woodland Streets on the east, south, and west, and by railroad tracks north of Sargeant Street to the north. The area retains much of its late 19th-century character, with relatively few modern intrusions."}}
