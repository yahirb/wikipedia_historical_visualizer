{"Davenport": {"Frank Picklum House": "The Frank Picklum House is a historic building located in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. Picklum, who was a bricklayer and later a contractor, was the first person to live in the house and may have built it. Rooms were available for rent in the house by the late 1890s, but Picklum still lived here."}}
