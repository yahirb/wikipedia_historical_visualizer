{"Omaha": {"Crossroads Mall (Omaha)": "Crossroads Mall is an enclosed shopping mall located in Omaha, Nebraska at the intersection of 72nd and Dodge Streets. Originally opened in 1960 by Omaha's Brandeis department store, the mall has been home to several major chains, including Sears, Dillard's, Younkers and Target. Most of the mall is expected to be demolished in the near future and replaced with a new mixed-use development."}}
