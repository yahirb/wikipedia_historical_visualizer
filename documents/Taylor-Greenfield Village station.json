{"Taylor": {"Greenfield Village station": "Greenfield Village is a former conditional Amtrak station in Dearborn, Michigan, served by the Wolverine. It was a stop for the Henry Ford Museum and was only used for reserved tour groups of 20 or more people, thus making it one of Amtrak's least-busy stations. Prior to 2006, the station was a regular, but seasonal stop (summer only)."}}
