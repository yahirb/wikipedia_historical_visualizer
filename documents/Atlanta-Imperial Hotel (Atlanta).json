{"Atlanta": {"Imperial Hotel (Atlanta)": "The Imperial Hotel in Atlanta is one of the few remaining tall buildings from the city's construction boom in the early 20th century. The former hotel was opened in 1910, has 8 stories, and is representative of the Chicago school due to the flat roof and brick facade with grids of bay windows. It contains two historic Otis elevators."}}
