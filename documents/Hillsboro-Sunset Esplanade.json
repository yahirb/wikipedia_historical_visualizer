{"Hillsboro": {"Sunset Esplanade": "The Sunset Esplanade is an outdoor shopping center located in the southeast part of Hillsboro, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Opened in 1989, the center is along Tualatin Valley Highway (TV Highway) at Minter Bridge Road and includes about five anchor tenants and about thirty other tenants in a complex with about 363,000 square feet (33,700 m2) of space. Neighbors opposed the center when it was proposed, due to concerns over increased traffic and how it would blend with existing residential neighborhoods."}}
