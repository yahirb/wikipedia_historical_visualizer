{"Parma": {"Puritas \u2013 West 150th (RTA Rapid Transit station)": "East 34th\u2013Campus Station is station on the RTA Rapid Transit system in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, serving the Red, Blue and Green Lines. It is located just east of East 34th Street near the intersection of East 34th and Broadway, on the north side of the CSX railway tracks, and below the bridge that carries East 34th Street over the railway tracks.\nThe station is somewhat unusual in that it combines a high-level platform rapid transit station with a low-level platform light rail station."}}
