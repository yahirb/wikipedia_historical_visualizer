{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Peabody College": "Peabody College of Education and Human Development was founded in 1875 when the University of Nashville, located in Nashville, Tennessee, split into two separate educational institutions. The preparatory school, University School of Nashville, separated from the college, which was originally called Peabody Normal School, but soon became known as the George Peabody College for Teachers. Peabody was merged into Vanderbilt University in 1979."}}
