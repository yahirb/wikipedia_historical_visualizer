{"Sacramento": {"St. Rose of Lima Park": "Saint Rose of Lima, T.O.S.D. (April 20, 1586 \u2013 August 24, 1617), was a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in Lima, Peru, who became known for both her life of severe asceticism and her care of the needy of the city through her own private efforts. A lay member of the Dominican Order, she has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church, being the first person born in the Americas to be canonized as a saint.\nAs a saint, Rose of Lima has been designated as a co-patroness of the Philippines along with Saint Pudentiana; both saints were both moved to second-class patronage in September 1942, by Pope Pius XII, but Rose remains the primary patroness of Peru and the indigenous natives of Latin America."}}
