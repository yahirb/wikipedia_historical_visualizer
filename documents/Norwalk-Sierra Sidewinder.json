{"Norwalk": {"Sierra Sidewinder": "Sierra Sidewinder is a steel spinning roller coaster located in the Camp Snoopy section of Knott's Berry Farm. It is the first ever roller coaster to feature multiple free spinning cars on a train, rather than several individual spinning cars. The only other spinning train coaster is Euro-Mir at Europa-Park in Germany, however the spinning of the trains is controlled throughout the ride."}}
