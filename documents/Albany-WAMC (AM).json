{"Albany": {"WAMC (AM)": "WAMC is a public radio station licensed to Albany, New York and owned by WAMC, Inc. The station broadcasts at 1400 kHz at 1 kW unlimited, and is an AM repeater of WAMC-FM.\nFor 68 years, the station held the WABY calls, which were later located on an unrelated radio station broadcasting at 1160 kHz from Mechanicville, New York (which had been WMVI and took the WABY calls as a tribute to the original WABY).\n\n\n== History ==\nWAMC came into the Albany market in 1934 as WABY when Al Kelert moved radio station WGLC from Hudson Falls, New York to Albany in turn making the first station to broadcast from that city (though not the first one to originate, a distinction held by WOKO, now WOPG)."}}
