{"Cypress": {"Puvunga": "Puvunga (alternate spelling: Puvungna) is an ancient village and burial site thought to have once been populated by the Tongva (Gabrieli\u00f1o) people, who are the indigenous inhabitants of the region around Los Angeles, California. The site is located near the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden on the campus of present-day California State University, Long Beach along the banks of a now channelized creek, about three miles (5 km) from the Pacific Ocean. Puvunga is believed to be the birthplace of Chingishnish, the major deity or culture hero in Tongva mythology, and claimed as sacred, by some Tongva tribal council representatives."}}
