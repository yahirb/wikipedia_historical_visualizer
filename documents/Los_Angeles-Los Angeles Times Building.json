{"Los_Angeles": {"Los Angeles Times Building": "The Los Angeles Times Building is an art deco building in Times Mirror Square at 1st and Spring Streets in Los Angeles, California. It is the headquarters of the Los Angeles Times and was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann.\nIn 1935, when the first part of the building was opened, Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".\nThe building, despite its historic and architecturally significant appearance, appears not to be listed as a historic landmark. It does not appear in listings of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments, California Historical Landmarks, or U.S. Registered Historic Landmarks in Los Angeles.\nThe Los Angeles Times Building is the site of two previous city halls and the current city hall is on an adjacent block:\nA building at South Spring Street and West 2nd Street was used as City Hall from 1884 to 1888\nA Romanesque Revival building on 226-238 South Broadway between 2nd Street and 3rd Street was built as City Hall in 1888, but demolished in 1928; it is now occupied by the LA Times Parking structure and another building, at 240 Broadway."}}
