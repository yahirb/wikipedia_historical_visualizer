{"Chicago": {"Silversmith Hotel": "The Silversmith Hotel & Suites is a boutique hotel located in downtown Chicago, Illinois, USA. Managed by Remington Hotels Inc., the hotel occupies the historic Silversmith Building. In the late 1890s, the Arts and Crafts Movement began to replace Romanesque Revival architecture. In 1896, Peter J. Weber, of the architectural firm of D.H. Burnham and Company, designed the Silversmith to reflect this transition."}}
