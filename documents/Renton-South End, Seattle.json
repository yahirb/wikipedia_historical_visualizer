{"Renton": {"South End, Seattle": "The South End is a group of neighborhoods in the southeast of Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.. The definition is a bit fluid, but has traditionally included the area south of the Central District, and east of Interstate 5: Rainier Valley, Rainier Beach, Seward Park, Mount Baker, and Beacon Hill. Sometimes its definition is extended to Skyway and Bryn Mawr in unincorporated King County, though these are not technically in the city."}}
