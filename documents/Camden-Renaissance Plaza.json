The previous World Trade Square complex design was to be developed by Carl Marks Real Estate Group and called for four high-rise office buildings: Old City Harbor Tower I, Old City Harbor Tower II, Old City Harbor Tower III, and the Greater Philadelphia World Trade Center. The tallest buildings would have been the Old City Harbor Towers II and III, which were planned as twin office skyscrapers that each rise 636 feet (194 m), with 37 floors."}}
