{"Cranston": {"Providence Public Library": "The Providence Public Library of Providence, Rhode Island was founded in 1875. The Central Library building at 225 Washington Street opened in 1900 and was constructed in a Renaissance style with private donations including a large donation from John Nicholas Brown I, and a large addition was built in 1954. The library is different from most city libraries because it is governed and funded privately but serves the public."}}
