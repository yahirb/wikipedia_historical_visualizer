{"New_York": {"The Tombs": "For the 2012 Clive Cussler novel, see The Tombs (novel), for the 1991 Argentine film, see The Tombs (film).\n\nThe Tombs is the colloquial name for the Manhattan Detention Complex (formerly the Bernard B. Kerik Complex), a municipal jail in Lower Manhattan at 125 White Street, as well as the nickname for three previous city-run jails in the former Five Points neighborhood of lower Manhattan, an area now known as the Civic Center.\nThe original Tombs, officially known as the Halls of Justice, was built in 1838 in the Egyptian Revival style. It was a replacement for the colonial era Bridewell Prison, located in today's City Hall Park. The new structure incorporated material from the Bridewell (built in 1735 and demolished in 1838), mainly granite, to save money.\nThe four buildings known as The Tombs were:\nTombs I, 1838\u20131902, New York City Halls of Justice and House of Detention\nTombs II, 1902\u20131941, City Prison\nTombs III, 1941\u20131974, Manhattan House of Detention\nTombs IV, 1983/1990\u2013present, Manhattan Detention Complex (known as the Bernard B. Kerik Complex from 2001 to 2006)"}}
