{"Bellevue": {"Seattle Washington Temple": "The Seattle Washington Temple (formerly the Seattle Temple) is the 21st constructed and 19th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Located in the city of Bellevue, Washington, it has a modern single-spire design. Due to its proximity to the Bellevue Airfield, the proposed height of the spire was reduced, and a red strobe warning light was installed at the base of the angel Moroni statue."}}
