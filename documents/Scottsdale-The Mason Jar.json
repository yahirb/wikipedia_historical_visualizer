{"Scottsdale": {"The Mason Jar": "A Mason jar, named after John Landis Mason who first invented and patented it in 1858, is a molded glass jar used in home canning to preserve food. The jar's mouth has a screw thread on its outer perimeter to accept a metal ring (or \"band\"). The band, when screwed down, presses a separate stamped tin-plated steel disc-shaped lid against the jar's rim."}}
