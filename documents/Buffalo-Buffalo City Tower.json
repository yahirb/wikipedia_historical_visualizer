{"Buffalo": {"Buffalo City Tower": "Buffalo City Tower was an approved 40-story, mixed-use, tower aiming to be the tallest in downtown Buffalo. It was to be developed by British property development company BSC Group, headed up by entrepreneur Bashar Issa. Details included: retail focused on the corner of S. Elmwood and Mohawk Street, 20 floors of office space at 24,400 GSF/floor, 10 floors of hotel totaling 300 rooms each at 380\u2013500 square feet (35\u201346 m2), and 10 floors of 80 condos each at 965\u20131,500 square feet (89.7\u2013139.4 m2). Parking was to be accommodated in three underground and six above ground levels with a total of between 800 and 1150 spaces depending if stacking is used.\nThe project was canceled in 2008 due to Issa's financial troubles in Manchester and Buffalo.\nIssa eventually sold the downtown Buffalo parcel, located at the corner of West Mohawk Street and South Elmwood Avenue, to local developer Mark Croce who currently operates it as a surface parking lot.\nIssa, who floated plans for a 40-story, $361 million mixed-use complex, bought the lot for $1 million in June 2006.\nIssa also purchased the Statler Hotel, located across the street, and aimed to invest $100 million in renovating that building to return it to its former glory. The building was placed into involuntary bankruptcy in 2009 and sold at auction to private investors, including Mark Croce."}}
