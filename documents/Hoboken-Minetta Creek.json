{"Hoboken": {"Minetta Creek": "Minetta Creek (sometimes called Minetta Brook, Minetta Stream, Minetta Water, Minetta Waters, or by its Dutch name Bestevaer's Killetje, before the American Revolutionary War), was a stream that was among the largest natural watercourses in Manhattan, New York City. Minetta Creek was fed from two tributaries, one originating at Fifth Avenue and 21st Street, and the other originating at Sixth Avenue and 16th Street. They joined near Fifth Avenue and 11th Street then took a southwesterly course."}}
