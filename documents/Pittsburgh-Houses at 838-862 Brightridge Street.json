{"Pittsburgh": {"Houses at 838-862 Brightridge Street": "The Houses at 838-862 Brightridge Street in the Perry South neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, were built in 1887 on both sides of what was then called Brighton Place. Twelve houses were built on the north side of the street and 13 were built on the south side. They are similar in size and floor plan to the row houses on Charles Street that were also built by William A. Stone, who later became governor of Pennsylvania."}}
