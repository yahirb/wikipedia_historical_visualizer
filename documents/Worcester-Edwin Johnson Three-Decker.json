{"Worcester": {"Edwin Johnson Three-Decker": "The Edwin Johnson Three-Decker is an historic three-decker at 183 Austin Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. When the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was highlighted for its Queen Anne styling, including a three-tier porch with turned balusters, bracketed roofs, and spindled friezes. Since then, much of this detail has been removed or obscured (see photo)."}}
