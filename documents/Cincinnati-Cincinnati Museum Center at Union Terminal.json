{"Cincinnati": {"Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal": "The Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, originally Cincinnati Union Terminal, is a former passenger railroad station in the Queensgate neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. After the decline of railroad travel, most of the building was converted to other uses, and now houses museums, theaters, and a library, as well as special travelling exhibitions. Built in 1933, it is a monumental example of Art Deco architecture, for which it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977."}}
