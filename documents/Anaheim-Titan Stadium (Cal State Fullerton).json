{"Anaheim": {"Titan Stadium (Cal State Fullerton)": "Titan Stadium is a 10,000-capacity multi-purpose stadium on the campus of California State University, Fullerton in Fullerton, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nScheduled to open in time for the 1991 football season, delays caused the opening date of Titan Stadium to be pushed back until 1992. Despite originally being planned as the home stadium for the CSUF Titans football program, the delays in stadium construction put in question the possibility of the team actually taking the field."}}
