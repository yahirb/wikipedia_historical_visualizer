{"Springfield": {"History of Springfield, Massachusetts": "Springfield, Massachusetts was founded in 1636 as Agawam, the northernmost settlement of the Connecticut Colony. The settlement defected from Connecticut after four years, however, later joining forces with the coastal Massachusetts Bay Colony. The town changed its name to Springfield, and changed the political boundaries among what later became New England States."}}
