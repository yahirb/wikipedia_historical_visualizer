{"Providence": {"Providence Dyeing, Bleaching, Calendring Company": "Providence Dyeing, Bleaching, Calendring Company (or Valley Bleachery) is an historic industrial complex located at 46,50,52,60 Valley Street and 80 Delaine Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It consists of 18 small-to-medium-sized brick and stone structures in a parcel 4 acres (1.6 ha) in size, between Valley Street and the Woonasquatucket River. Although most of these buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1920, the oldest building in the complex is a single-story rubble stone structure which may contain elements of an 18th-century mill structure, and is known to have achieved its present form around 1837."}}
