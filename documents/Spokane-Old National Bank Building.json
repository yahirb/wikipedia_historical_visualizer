{"Spokane": {"Old National Bank Building": "The Old National Bank building, in Spokane, Washington, was completed in 1911 and was the first skyscraper in the Inland Northwest. This fifteen story tower reaches to a height of 217 feet (66 m) above the Spokane valley and was the city's tallest building until the Paulsen Center was completed across the street on Riverside Ave. The Old National Bank building served as a symbol of prosperity for the rising economy of the Inland Empire."}}
