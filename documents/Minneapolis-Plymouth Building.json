{"Minneapolis": {"Plymouth Building": "The Plymouth Building is a 12-story building in Minneapolis. Built in 1910-1911, it was touted as the world's largest all reinforced concrete office building at the time it was constructed.\nIn 1936 the building's exterior was renovated, removing much of the ornamentation and beaux arts styling in favor of a cleaner and more modern appearance."}}
