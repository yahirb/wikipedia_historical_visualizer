{"Lynn": {"Greenlawn Cemetery (Salem, Massachusetts)": "Greenlawn Cemetery is a historic cemetery at 57 Orne Street in Salem, Massachusetts. The cemetery was founded in 1807, but received a major redesign in the 1880s to bring it into the then-popular rural cemetery style, with winding lanes and landscaping. The 100-acre (40 ha) is notable for its large number of specimen plants, which is second in the state to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston."}}
