{"Boston": {"Charlestown High Bridge": "The Charlestown High Bridge (referred to as the John F. Fitzgerald Bridge on old AAA Tourbook maps), spanned the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts, and was part of I-93/US 1 at the north end of the Central Artery.\nThis double-decked truss bridge, built in 1954, was to originally carry I-95 through Boston from southwest to northeast in tandem with the Tobin Bridge, built in 1950. The I-95 project and several other highway projects in and around Boston, including both the highly controversial Inner Belt (I-695) and the Southwest Corridor, completing the right-of-way intended to bring I-95 into Boston from Providence, RI, were cancelled due to heavy public opposition in the early 1970s."}}
