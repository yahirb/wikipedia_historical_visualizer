{"Kansas_City": {"Giralda (Kansas City)": "The Giralda is the name of a landmark in Kansas City, Missouri. It stands 138 feet (42 m) tall at the corner of West 47th Street and J.C. Nichols Parkway.\nWhen urban developer J.C. Nichols visited Seville, Spain in the 1920s, he was so impressed with the 12th-century Moorish tower of Giralda that he built a half-scale replica in the Country Club Plaza."}}
