{"Cheyenne": {"Park Addition School": "The Park Addition School at 1100 Richardson Court in Cheyenne, Wyoming was built in 1921. It was designed by architect Frederick Hutchinson Porter. Due to population growth, an addition was built during the 1947-1949 school year, and the school was renamed \"Chaplin School\" in the honor of Miss Ruth Chaplin who served as principal from its inception until the 1952-1953 school year."}}
