{"West_Des_Moines": {"Valley West Mall": "Valley West Mall is an enclosed super-regional shopping mall in West Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrederick Watson, a developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota, first unveiled plans for Valley West Mall in 1971. The Meredith Corporation initially objected to the mall since it was right next to a site where Meredith planned to build its new corporate headquarters, but Meredith withdrew its plan to relocate there in June 1971."}}
