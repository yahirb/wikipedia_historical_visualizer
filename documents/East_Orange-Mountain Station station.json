{"East_Orange": {"Mountain Station station": "Mountain Station is a New Jersey Transit station in South Orange, Essex County, New Jersey, United States, along the Morris and Essex (formerly Erie Lackawanna Morristown Line). The station, built in 1915, has been listed in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places since 1984 and is part of the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource.\nThe station is somewhat unusual in that when the Lackawanna Railroad rebuilt the Morristown Line during the 1910s and 1920s, to eliminate grade crossings between Newark and Millburn, Mountain Station was the only location at which the elevation of the railroad's roadbed was not changed."}}
