{"Akron": {"Cathedral of Tomorrow": "The Cathedral of Tomorrow was built in 1958 as home to Rex Humbard's ministry. The Cathedral, a round building with the sanctuary in the middle and classrooms and offices around the edges, located in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, seats 5,400. It has a domed roof with a large illuminated cross that hangs from the ceiling. The cross weighs 32 tons (to give the domed roof greater architectural strength during wind storms) and is illuminated with 4,700 lights which can change colors. It is one of the largest interior crosses in the world. When the cathedral was built it was the largest permanently domed building in the world without interior pillar support. This gives the audience greater visibility toward the stage.\nUnder Humbard's ministry, Cathedral services were broadcast on 600 television stations in the United States and Canada, as well as on stations in many other countries.\nThe influential gospel quartet the Cathedral Quartet was formed at the Cathedral of Tomorrow (hence the group's name), originally as a trio."}}
