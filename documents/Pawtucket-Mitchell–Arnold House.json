{"Pawtucket": {"Mitchell\u2013Arnold House": "The Mitchell\u2013Arnold House is an historic house located at 41 Waldo Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nIt is a picturesque 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, built in 1871 and added to and modified in subsequent decades. It began as a flank-gable cottage, a form typical for the time, and was gradually extended with projecting sections, additions, and an elaborately decorated porch to create a fine example of Queen Anne architecture."}}
