{"Pittsburgh": {"New Granada Theater": "The New Granada Theater at 2007 Centre Avenue in the Hill District neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was built in 1927 and 1928. This Art Deco theater was designed by architect Louis A. S. Bellinger, and originally was a Pythian Temple, a meeting place for the Knights of Pythias (a fraternal order and secret society). In this case, it was a lodge for a group of African American construction workers known as the Knights of the Pythian."}}
