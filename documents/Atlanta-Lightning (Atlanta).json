{"Atlanta": {"Lightning (Atlanta)": "Lightning was a neighborhood just west of Downtown Atlanta, Georgia, north of the former extension of Magnolia Street, south of Simpson St. (now Joseph E. Boone Blvd.) and east of Northside Drive (US 41). It was razed to make way mostly for the expansion of the Georgia World Congress Center as well as the north end of the Georgia Dome."}}
