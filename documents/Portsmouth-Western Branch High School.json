{"Portsmouth": {"Western Branch High School": "Western Branch High School is a suburban high school in Chesapeake, Virginia, USA. Established in 1968, it currently has over 2200 students. The two feeder schools of WBHS are Joliff Middle School and Western Branch Middle School. After it was determined that redistricting due to the opening of Grassfield High School was not going to impact WBHS, a $40,000,000 construction project was funded to accommodate the larger student body and modernize the technology and facilities."}}
