{"New_Haven": {"Battell Chapel": "Battell Chapel is the largest chapel of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Built in 1874\u201376 as a Civil War memorial, it was funded primarily with gifts from Joseph Battell and others of his family. Succeeding two previous chapel buildings on Yale's Old Campus, it provided space for daily chapel services, which were mandatory for Yale College students until 1926."}}
