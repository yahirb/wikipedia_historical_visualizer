{"Cicero": {"South Lawndale, Chicago": "South Lawndale, one of Chicago's 77 well-defined community areas, is on the West Side of the city of Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Little Village ===\nNow mainly inhabited by Mexican immigrants, Little Village was originally settled by Eastern European and Czech and Bohemian immigrants in the late 19th century, after the Great Chicago Fire sent the population of Chicago rippling out from the city's center to the outlying countryside. Jobs created by industrial development in the early 20th century also attracted residents to the area."}}
