{"New_York": {"Murry Bergtraum High School": "The Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers is a public secondary school in New York City. It is located in Lower Manhattan, adjacent to the Brooklyn Bridge and City Hall. Bergtraum offers business-oriented courses to prepare students for careers in marketing, tourism, finance, human resources, information systems, economics, computer science, law, and secretarial fields. The school also combines its business curriculum with an academic program that gears towards preparation for college. In recent years, the school has been integrating more humanities and liberal arts courses to enrich the school's curriculum.\nMurry Bergtraum High School was one of the first business-themed high schools in New York City, and inclusively, the United States. It has two sister schools that share its business theme: Norman Thomas High School (previously known as Central Commercial High School) and the High School of Economics and Finance. Out of the three schools, Murry Bergtraum is the largest of all the business high schools in this category and in the city due to its large, diverse business programs and course offerings.\nStudents in virtual enterprise classes have formed two companies in insurance and publishing. Other students get retail experience in a school store funded by Ronald Lauder, head of Est\u00e9e Lauder. The goal of former Principal Grace Julian was to have every student have a mentor from a corporation such as Est\u00e9e Lauder for at least part of their high school career. Students and alumni often refer to themselves as \"Bergtraumites.\"\nIt remains as one of the few large high schools in New York City as a result of Michael Bloomberg's small-school restructuring projects. It was also exempted from chancellor Joel Klein's citywide uniform curriculum initiated in 2003."}}
