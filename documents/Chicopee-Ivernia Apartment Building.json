{"Chicopee": {"Ivernia Apartment Building": "The Ivernia Apartment Building is a historic residential apartment building at 91-93 Pine Street on the east side of Springfield, Massachusetts. It is a four-story brick structure, built out of glazed red brick with marble trim. The building is larger than typical apartment houses of the period in which it was built (1910), housing twelve units unstead of the usual eight."}}
