{"Boston": {"Beacon Theatre (Boston)": "The Beacon Theatre (1910-1948) of Boston, Massachusetts, was a cinema on Tremont Street in the 20th century. Jacob Lourie established it. Architect Clarence Blackall designed the building, with its 500-seat auditorium which a contemporary critic described as \"showy.\" It had a staff of 26 in 1910. In 1948 the \"refurbished\" building became the Beacon Hill Theater. The building existed until 1970."}}
