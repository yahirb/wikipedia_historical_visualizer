{"Duluth": {"Duluth North Pier Light": "The Duluth North Pier Light is a lighthouse on the north breakwater at the entrance to the Duluth Ship Canal.\n\n\n== History ==\nAn 1896 project to improve harbor facilities resulted in the reconstruction of the sides of the ship canal, bracketing it in the two concrete piers which define its channel to the present. While the south pier had been equipped with a light from 1874, the north pier was unlit, and given the difficult approach (highlighted by the notorious wreck of the SS Mataafa in 1905), calls for aids were soon made."}}
