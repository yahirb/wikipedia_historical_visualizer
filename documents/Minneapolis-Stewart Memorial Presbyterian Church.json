{"Minneapolis": {"Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church": "Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church, now Redeemer Missionary Baptist Church, is a Prairie School church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the Lyndale neighborhood. The Prairie School architecture was uncommon for use in churches. This church, which has a flat roof and broad eaves, but lacks a bell tower and other traditional church features, was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois."}}
