{"Jersey_City": {"Abel I. Smith Burial Ground": "The Abel I. Smith Burial Ground (also spelled Able I. Smith Burial Ground) was a family burial plot in Hudson County, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe land owned by Abel Smith stretched far; in a 1908 edition of The New York Times, the farm is said to have been bisected by Secaucus Road, and \"between the Paterson Plank Road on the north, the Penn Horn Creek on the East, the lands of S. Jacobs on the south, and the old Secaucus racetrack to the west.\"\n\nThe burial ground lay in a grove at one of the highest spots in Secaucus, obscured by high grass and trees, overlooking the expanse of the meadows and into the Hackensack River. It was bordered on the west side by County Road and the grounds of a Mental Disease Hospital that is no longer in existence, currently located near the intersection of Secaucus Road and County Road."}}
