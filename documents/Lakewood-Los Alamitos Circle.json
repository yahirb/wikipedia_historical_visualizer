{"Lakewood": {"Los Alamitos Circle": "The Los Alamitos Traffic Circle, informally known as the Long Beach Traffic Circle (or just the Traffic Circle, as there are no other high volume traffic circles in Southern California), is a roundabout at the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19), Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1/former U.S. Route 101 Alternate) and Los Coyotes Diagonal in Long Beach, California. The intersection was originally constructed as a traffic circle in 1930 and reconstructed as a modern roundabout in 1993.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1930, German engineer Werner Ruchti was contracted to design the traffic circle, which was to be based on European models."}}
