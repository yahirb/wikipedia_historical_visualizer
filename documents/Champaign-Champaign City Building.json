{"Champaign": {"Champaign City Building": "The Champaign City Building serves as a symbol of the city, with its likeness featured on the city seal. Designated a Champaign Landmark on July 18, 2005, the ornate decoration, art deco architecture, and copper roof distinguish the building as one of the most recognizable in downtown Champaign. The main inspiration for the building's art deco design was Los Angeles City Hall."}}
