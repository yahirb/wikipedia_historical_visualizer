{"New_York": {"Hotel Attraction": "Hotel Attraction was a proposed project by architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, for a skyscraper in New York City.\nThe project was commissioned in May 1908. Planned at a total height of 360 metres, many believed its futuristic design to be unrealistic for its time. Little is known about its origin, and the project remained unknown until 1956, when a report by Joan Matamala i Flotats was published, called \"When the New World called Gaud\u00ed\". There are two stories as to why the project was cancelled; that Gaudi fell ill, or that he, as a Communist, cancelled the project on principle after objecting to it catering to wealthy clients.\nThe drawings for the Attraction Hotel were proposed as a basis for the rebuilding of Ground Zero in Manhattan. A modified version of the drawings by Paul Laffoley earned broad media attention. The architect planned to feature a memorial at its base and the Sphere for Plaza Fountain as center of an observation platform at the top of the hotel.\nThe hotel was featured in the Fox Broadcasting television show Fringe. It was featured in the New York City skyline in the alternate universe.\n\n"}}
