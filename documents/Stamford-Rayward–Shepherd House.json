{"Stamford": {"Rayward\u2013Shepherd House": "The Rayward\u2013Shepherd House, also known as Tirranna and as the John L. Rayward House, was designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright and built in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1955 for Joyce and John Rayward. Although commissioned by the Raywards, Herman R. Shepherd completed the design after purchasing it in 1964. William Allin Storrer credits Shepherd's actions with salvaging the house, repairing the poor work that Storrer attributes to John Rayward's \"constant pursuit of the lowest bid.\"\n\"Tirranna\" is an Australian aboriginal word meaning \"running waters,\" an apt name for this spectacular residence. Located on a pond just off the Noroton River, it features elaborate land and water-scaping. Built of standard concrete block (not Wright's more typical textile block), glass, and Colorundum flooring, and trimmed with Philippine mahogany, most of the house conforms to a hemicycle plan. Its living/dining wing overlooks a pool which steps down to a pond and extensive landscaped gardens, designed by Frank Okamura, landscape architect for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Charles Middeleer, a notable local landscape architect, also contributed to the landscape design.\nThe Rayward House includes a later (1958) extension by Taliesin Associated Architects, featuring an observatory above the master bedroom dressing room, as well as a playhouse for the Raywards\u2019 daughters, Victoria and Jennifer (1957), also designed by TAA, which echoes the hemicycle form of the main house.\nIt had been purchased in the late 1990s by businessman Ted Stanley and his wife Vada. After Stanley's death, the property with 15-acres was put on the market in January 2017 for $8,000,000 USD by his heirs."}}
