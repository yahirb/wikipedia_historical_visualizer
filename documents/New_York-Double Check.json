{"New_York": {"Double Check": "In chess, a double check is a check delivered by two pieces simultaneously. In chess notation, it is almost always represented the same way as a single check (\"+\"), but is sometimes symbolized by \"++\" (however, \"++\" is also sometimes used to denote checkmate)."}}
