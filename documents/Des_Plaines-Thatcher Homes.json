{"Des_Plaines": {"Thatcher Homes": "Thatcher Homes were a post\u2013World War II housing complex set up in Norwood Park Township in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the last half of the 1940s with the return of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the Second World War, there arose an acute housing shortage as these vets married and began to raise their families. Many of them lived with parents or other relatives until the U.S. Congress passed legislation creating the Federal Housing Administration and authorizing it to contract with local authorities to construct temporary veterans housing."}}
