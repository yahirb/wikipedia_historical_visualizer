{"Cincinnati": {"L.B. Robb Drugstore": "The L.B. Robb Drugstore was a historic pharmacy in the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Erected in 1860, it was a four-story building, constructed of brick on a stone foundation and topped with a slate roof. The building was a simple rectangle in its floor plan, although not without embellishments: the roof, which rose to gables on the sides, was crowned by a large central chimney, while the gables were ornamented with machicolations, and the walls were anchored by brick pilasters."}}
