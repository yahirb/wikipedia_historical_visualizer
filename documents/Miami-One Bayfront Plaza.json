{"Miami": {"One Bayfront Plaza": "One Bayfront Plaza is a proposed supertall skyscraper at one point approved for construction in the U.S. city of Miami, Florida. If completed, the building would stand at 1,005 feet (306 m), with 80 floors, becoming the tallest building in Miami and Florida. One Bayfront Plaza would primarily consist of offices and hotel space, but also would include a retail mall, condominiums, and parking garage on the lower levels, as well as possibly an observation deck at the top."}}
