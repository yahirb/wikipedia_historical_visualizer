{"Alexandria": {"Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial": "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is located in West Potomac Park next to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It covers four acres and includes the Stone of Hope, a granite statue of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King carved by sculptor Lei Yixin. The inspiration for the memorial design is a line from King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech: \"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\" The memorial opened to the public on August 22, 2011, after more than two decades of planning, fund-raising, and construction."}}
