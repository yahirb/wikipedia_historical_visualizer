{"Glendale": {"Avenel Cooperative Housing Project": "Avenel Cooperative Housing Project, properly known as Avenel Homes, is a 10-unit cooperative housing development designed by architect Gregory Ain, and built in 1947 in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles. Ain's innovative design has been called \"a model for effective use of limited space for low-cost urban housing.\"\n\n\n== Members ==\nOf the ten original members of the cooperative, at least four were blacklisted or questioned by the House Un-American Activities Committee, leading to the conclusion that the project was \"a cooperative living experiment for a group of communists.\" Resident and architect Richard Corsini noted: \"Most of the people that originally lived here were path-breaking political types,\" and even after the communist cooperative broke up, the structures remained popular with progressive homeowners. (The claim that the units were originally built for a group of motion picture cartoonists and their families is not correct, but applies instead to Ain's Community Homes project of the same period.)\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAvenel Homes consists of ten identical three-bedroom units of 960 square feet (89 m2), situated on two 60-foot (18 m) lots, each 140 feet (43 m) deep."}}
