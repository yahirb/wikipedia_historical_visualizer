With an estimated construction date of 1700\u20131720, it is believed to be the oldest house in Newton. It is also a rare example of a First Period house that was started as a single cell (three bays with chimney behind one bay), that was expanded to five bays later in the First Period; such expansion usually took place later in the 18th century, during the Georgian period."}}
