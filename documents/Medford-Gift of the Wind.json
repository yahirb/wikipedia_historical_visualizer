{"Medford": {"Gift of the Wind": "Gift of the Wind is a large-scale public kinetic sculpture, by Susumu Shingu, located in Porter Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Porter, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway and commuter rail station. The art work consists of a tall white pole with three red \"wings\" attached to the top that are \"designed to shift in response to the movement of the wind, not only turning clockwise and counterclockwise, but tumbling over and over in various sequences.\" It is considered by some to be \"Cambridge's most visible landmark,\" but, in 2010, it was also one of the nominees for \"Worst Public Art in New England\" by a regional art blog.\n\n\n== History ==\nGift of the Wind was commissioned in 1983 and unveiled in 1985 as a part of the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council's Arts on the Line program."}}
