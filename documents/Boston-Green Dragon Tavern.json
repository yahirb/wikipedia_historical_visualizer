{"Boston": {"Green Dragon Tavern": "The Green Dragon Tavern was a public house used as a tavern and meeting place located on Union Street in Boston's North End.\nThe property had been inherited by Mehitable (Minot) Cooper from her uncle, William Stoughton, in 1701. The Green Dragon Tavern was purchased from her son, William Cooper, by William Douglas, physician and pamphleteer, in 1743. Douglas lived in the tavern, calling it his \"mansion house\". After his death in 1752, the tavern passed to his sister, who sold it to the St. Andrews Lodge of Freemasons in 1766. The Masons used the first floor for their meeting rooms led by Grand Master Joseph Warren followed by John Hancock. The basement tavern was used by several secret groups and became known by historians as the \"Headquarters of the Revolution\". The Sons of Liberty, Boston Committee of Correspondence and the Boston Caucus each met there. The Boston Tea Party was planned there and Paul Revere (a Mason) was sent from there to Lexington on his famous ride. In January 1788, a meeting of the mechanics and artisans of Boston passed a series of resolutions urging the importance of adopting the Federal Constitution pending at the time before a convention of delegates from around Massachusetts. The building was demolished in 1854.\nThe current Green Dragon Tavern is located on 11 Marshall Street in Boston's North End. Its publicity states that it is the \"headquarters of the revolution\", though its relationship to the demolished original pub is not immediately apparent."}}
