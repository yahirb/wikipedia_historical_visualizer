{"Fort_Wayne": {"John D. Haynes House": "The John D. Haynes House is a private residence in Fort Wayne, Indiana, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The house is a small and modest Usonian design in glass, red tidewater cypress, and Chicago Common Brick on a red concrete slab.\n\nThe gallery is offset to meet the rear of the great room at its center, rather than typically to one side."}}
