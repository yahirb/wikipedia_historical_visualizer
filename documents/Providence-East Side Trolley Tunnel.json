{"Providence": {"East Side Trolley Tunnel": "The East Side Trolley Tunnel is a tunnel in Providence, Rhode Island, originally built for trolley use in 1914, and now used for public transit buses. It runs for 2000 feet (600 meters) under College Hill on Providence's East Side, with its west end at South Main Street and its east end at Thayer Street. Prior to the construction of the Trolley Tunnel, the steepness of the streets climbing College Hill led to construction of the only cable-car system ever to be built in New England."}}
