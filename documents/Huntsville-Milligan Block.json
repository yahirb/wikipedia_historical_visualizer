{"Huntsville": {"Milligan Block": "The Milligan Block is a historic commercial building in Huntsville, Alabama. It was built in 1900 and represents the transition from vertically-oriented Italianate style to more restrained, horizontally-oriented commercial styles of the early 20th century. It retains Italianate details such as an applied metal cornice and arched windows, but eschews other applied decoration in favor of using structural elements to provide ornamentation."}}
