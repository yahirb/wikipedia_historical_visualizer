{"Hoboken": {"Chelsea Piers": "Chelsea Piers is a series of piers in Chelsea, on the West Side of Manhattan in New York City. Located to the west of the West Side Highway (Eleventh Avenue) and Hudson River Park and to the east of the Hudson River, they were originally a passenger ship terminal in the early 1900s that was used by the RMS Lusitania and was the destination of the RMS Titanic. The piers replaced a hodgepodge of run-down waterfront structures with a row of grand buildings embellished with pink granite facades."}}
