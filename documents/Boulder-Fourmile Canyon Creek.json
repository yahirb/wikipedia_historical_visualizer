{"Boulder": {"Fourmile Canyon Creek": "Fourmile Canyon Creek or Four Mile Canyon Creek is a tributary of Boulder Creek. Its source is northwest of Boulder, Colorado and flows through the northern part of the city for part of its length. It should not be confused with a similarly named stream that runs through Fourmile Canyon west of Boulder, which was the site of a major wildfire in 2010."}}
