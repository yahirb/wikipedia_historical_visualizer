{"Albany": {"The Albany Academies": "The Albany Academies are independent college-preparatory schools in Albany, New York, educating students from Preschool through Grade 12. In July 2007, the administrative teams of The Albany Academy and Albany Academy for Girls merged into The Albany Academies. Both schools retain much of their pre-merger tradition and character and each continues to give diplomas under its own name."}}
