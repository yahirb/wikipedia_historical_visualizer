{"Minneapolis": {"Loren L. Chadwick Cottages": "The Loren L. Chadwick Cottages are two cottages in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, in the Linden Hills neighborhood situated roughly south of Lake Calhoun and northwest of Lake Harriet. This area of Minneapolis was platted in 1882-83 as \"Cottage City\" by a local real estate developer, Louis F. Menage. He platted small lots of 25 feet (7.6 m) wide, as opposed to the normal lot width of 40 feet (12 m), in an effort to attract people who wanted to build summer lake cottages."}}
