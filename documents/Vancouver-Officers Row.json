{"Vancouver": {"Officers Row": "Officers Row, a part of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District, is a congregation of 21 of the former homes of U.S. military officers stationed at the Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington. The oldest of the homes, named the Grant House (after Ulysses S. Grant, who was stationed at the barracks as a Captain at that time but never lived in the house), dates from 1846, and the last edifice was constructed in 1906. In the 1970s a grassroots campaign to refurbish the dilapidated properties began to appear, and the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974."}}
