{"South_San_Francisco": {"Daly City station": "Daly City is a Bay Area Rapid Transit station located in extreme northern San Mateo County, California, in suburban Daly City, less than one block outside the San Francisco city and county limits. Interstate 280 and California Route 1 run along the immediate west side of the station. Before BART service was extended farther south to Colma in 1996 and Millbrae in 2003, Daly City Station was the only BART station in San Mateo County as opposed to mostly San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa Counties and served as the terminal station (now at Millbrae) on the San Francisco Peninsula for the BART system."}}
