{"Manchester": {"Roger Sullivan House": "The Roger Sullivan House is a historic house at 168 Walnut Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was designed by local architect William M. Butterfield, and built in 1892 for Roger G. Sullivan, owner of one the nation's largest nationally distributed cigar manufacturers. The house is an exuberant expression of Queen Anne design, with varied gables, porches, chimneys, and bays, and a three-story turret capped with a conical roof."}}
