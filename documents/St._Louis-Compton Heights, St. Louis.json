{"St._Louis": {"Compton Heights, St. Louis": "The Compton Heights historic neighborhood, located near the south side of St. Louis, Missouri in the shadow of the great water tower of Reservoir Park, is one of the earliest planned residential developments of the American nineteenth century. Laid out in 1889 in accordance with a plan that viewed nature as neighbor and not as an enemy to be subjugated by some rectilinear grid, its wide setbacks and curving streets create remarkable vistas, which are punctuated by more than 200 homes of extraordinary and varied interest."}}
