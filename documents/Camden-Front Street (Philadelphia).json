{"Camden": {"Front Street (Philadelphia)": "Front Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is a north-south street running parallel to and near the Delaware River. Built when the city was laid out by William Penn in 1682, it was the first street surveyed and built in the new colony of Pennsylvania. As part of the King's Highway, which extended from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina, and as the waterfront of Philadelphia's port, it was the most important street in the city from its founding into the nineteenth century."}}
