It is located directly across from City Hall and adjacent to the Brooklyn Bridge, and houses most of the classrooms, administrative offices, a 2,000-square-foot (190 m2) student union, the 750-seat community theater of the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts, the Peter Fingesten Gallery, and an 18-floor high-rise known as Maria's Tower. Floors 5-17 of Maria's Tower houses approximately 500 freshmen residents and the 18th floor holds university administrative offices.\n1 Pace Plaza is on the former site of the New York Tribune Building. It was built during the urban renewal project of the 1960s known as the Brooklyn Bridge Title I Project, which included the South Bridge Towers on Gold Street, the Beekman Hospital (now New York Downtown Hospital) and the World Trade Center.\nThe architect designers of One Pace Plaza were Otto R. Eggers and Daniel P. Higgins firm Eggers & Higgins of New York, architects of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.
