Eastbound trains heading towards Northeast Philadelphia turn north after departing this station and begin to run along Front Street and, ultimately, Frankford Avenue for the remainder of the line. It is the easternmost stop in central Philadelphia and the last subterranean stop for eastbound trains."}}
