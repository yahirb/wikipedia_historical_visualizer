{"Burbank": {"The Mansion (recording studio)": "The Mansion is a 10-bedroom mansion owned by music producer Rick Rubin in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. Originally built in 1918, the house is famous for the successful bands who have recorded music there. Although many say that Harry Houdini lived at the mansion, no one has ever lived in the Mansion under the name \"Houdini\", a fact that Corey Taylor, singer of the bands Stone Sour and Slipknot, has said in his book A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Heaven."}}
