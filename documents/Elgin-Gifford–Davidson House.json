{"Elgin": {"Gifford\u2013Davidson House": "The Gifford\u2013Davidson House, also known as Stone Cottage, in Elgin, Illinois was built in 1850 and expanded in 1871. The Gifford\u2013Davidson House is unusual due to its cobblestone construction and Second Empire style details. This design would have been more typical in James Gifford's original home of New York City."}}
