{"Sparks": {"List of cathedrals in the United States": "This is a list of cathedrals in the United States, including both actual cathedrals (seats of bishops in episcopal denominations, such as Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, and Orthodoxy) and a few prominent churches from non-episcopal denominations that have the word \"cathedral\" in their names. The United States is, according to some ways of working it out, home to the largest Anglican cathedral in the world; the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine (Episcopal) in New York City.\nFor a complete list of the 193 cathedrals of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, see List of the Catholic cathedrals of the United States."}}
