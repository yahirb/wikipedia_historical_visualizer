{"La_Mesa": {"Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami": "Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami is a Sunni mosque in San Diego, California, on 7173 Saranac Street on the San Diego-La Mesa, California border.\nAnwar Al-Awlaki, who has been accused of being a senior Al-Qaeda recruiter and motivator linked to various terrorists, served as Imam of the mosque from 1996\u20132000.\nTwo of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks (Nawaf Al-Hazmi and Khalid Almihdhar) regularly attended the mosque in 2000, and Al-Awlaki had many closed-door meetings with them, which led investigators to believe Al-Awlaki knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance."}}
