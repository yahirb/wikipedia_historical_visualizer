{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Hale Stadium": "Hale Stadium is a 10,000-seat outdoor stadium located on the campus of Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee. Built in 1953 and nicknamed \"The Hole\", the stadium hosted TSU Tigers football games until 1999, when home games were moved to what is now Nissan Stadium, home of the Tennessee Titans. Allowing the Tigers to play their home games at the new venue was a requirement for the funding the new facility received from the State of Tennessee."}}
