{"Medford": {"Building at 10 Follen Street": "The Building at 10 Follen Street is an historic house at 10 Follen Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The three story wood frame house was designed by Peabody and Stearns and built in 1875. It is a rare well-preserved example of the transition between Second Empire and Stick styles, with a truncated hip roof, a highly decorated porch, and most of its original interior woodwork."}}
