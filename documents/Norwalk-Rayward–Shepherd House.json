{"Norwalk": {"Rayward\u2013Shepherd House": "The Rayward\u2013Shepherd House, also known as Tirranna and as the John L. Rayward House, was designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright and built in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1955 for Joyce and John Rayward. Although commissioned by the Raywards, Herman R. Shepherd completed the design after purchasing it in 1964. William Allin Storrer credits Shepherd's actions with salvaging the house, repairing the poor work that Storrer attributes to John Rayward's \"constant pursuit of the lowest bid.\"\n\"Tirranna\" is an Australian aboriginal word meaning \"running waters,\" an apt name for this spectacular residence."}}
