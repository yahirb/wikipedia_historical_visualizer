{"Rogers": {"Henry-Thompson House": "The Henry-Thompson House is a historic house at 302 SE Second Street in Bentonville, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick building, with Italianate styling that includes trusswork in the front-facing gable, a scrollwork balustrade on the main porch, and scrolled brackets on a hood over a secondary entrance. Built in 1890, this is a good representative of late Italianate style brick homes that were built in significant numbers in Bentonville between 1870 and 1895."}}
