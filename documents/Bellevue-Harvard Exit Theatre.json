{"Bellevue": {"Harvard Exit Theatre": "The Harvard Exit Theatre is a twin cinema located in Seattle, Washington. It is housed in a building built in 1925 by the Woman's Century Club, which still meets there at midday on the third Friday of the month. The building was sold in 1968 on the condition that the lobby not be altered, which it has not been to this day."}}
