{"New_Orleans": {"Capture of New Orleans": "The capture of New Orleans (April 25 \u2013 May 1, 1862) during the American Civil War was an important event for the Union. Having fought past Forts Jackson and St. Philip, the Union was unopposed in its capture of the city itself, which was spared the destruction suffered by many other Southern cities."}}
