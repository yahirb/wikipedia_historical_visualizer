{"Evansville": {"Culver Historic District": "Culver Historic District is a national historic district located at Evansville, Indiana. The neighborhood is all residential, and unlike most of the rest of the city, the lots are not laid out on a grid. Most of the houses are on a lot previously part of the farm owned by Robert Parrett, a native of England who settled in Evansville and built a house near the intersection of Madison Avenue and Parrett Street."}}
