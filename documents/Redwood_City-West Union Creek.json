{"Redwood_City": {"West Union Creek": "West Union Creek is a 4.5-mile-long (7.2 km) stream originating on the east slope of Kings Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains, in San Mateo County, California, United States. It flows easterly down to the valley formed by the San Andreas Rift where it turns near the Phleger Estate to flow southeasterly on an unusually level course (for a mountain stream) to Adobe Corner in the town of Woodside where it joins Bear Gulch Creek, which in turn flows to San Francisquito Creek and ultimately, San Francisco Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn August 1840, the Governor of Spanish California granted the land, later called Rancho Ca\u00f1ada de Raymundo, to John Coppinger, an Irishman who had become a naturalized Mexican citizen."}}
