{"Rogers": {"Applegate Drugstore": "The Applegate Drugstore is a historic commercial building at 116 South First Street in Rogers, Arkansas. It is a two-story masonry building, with brick sidewalls and a limestone facade. Pilasters of alternating rough and smooth stone delineate the first floor elements of the storefront, rising to a freeze and dentillated ogee course between the floors."}}
