{"New_Haven": {"Kennedy Mitchell Hall of Records": "The Kennedy Mitchell Hall of Records is located in New Haven, Connecticut and houses many of the City of New Haven's governmental functions, including finance, vital statistics, offices of the town clerk, and public hearing rooms where city policy is debated.\n\n\n== Building history ==\nThe Hall of Records, built in 1929, was intended to be part of a larger complex of government buildings; an uncompleted end wall can be seen that was to attach it to others in the complex. Its neoclassical style differs sharply from the late-19th-century urban buildings surrounding it at the time of its construction, and from those that now neighbor it."}}
