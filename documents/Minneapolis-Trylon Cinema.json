{"Minneapolis": {"Trylon Cinema": "The Trylon Cinema (formerly Trylon Microcinema) is a 92-seat movie theater in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The cinema was founded and is currently run by Take-Up Productions, a group of volunteers who got their start at the Oak Street Cinema before establishing the Trylon in 2009 within a former warehouse. A 2017 expansion led to an increase in the cinema's seating capacity and accessibility."}}
