{"New_York": {"5 World Trade Center": "5 World Trade Center (also referred to as 130 Liberty Street) is a planned skyscraper at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The site is across Liberty Street, to the south of the main 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site. The project is currently on standby while the Port Authority explores a potential sale of the lot to a developer and also finds tenants to occupy the skyscraper. The proposed building shares its name with the original 5 World Trade Center, which was heavily damaged as a result of the collapse of the North Tower during the September 11 attacks and was later demolished. The Port Authority has no plans to construct a building at 130 Liberty Street, although it is open to future development of the site as office, retail, hotel, residential or some mix of those uses.\nIn June 2007, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to develop the building as the headquarters of its J.P. Morgan Investment Bank. However, JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008 put those plans in doubt, given the company will relocate J.P. Morgan to 383 Madison Avenue."}}
