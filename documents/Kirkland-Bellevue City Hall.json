{"Kirkland": {"Bellevue City Hall": "The Bellevue City Hall is a government office building and city hall in Bellevue, Washington. The current city hall, located in Downtown Bellevue, opened in 2006 after the $121 million renovation of a former Qwest data center. The data center, originally built for Pacific Northwest Bell in 1983, was acquired by the city government in 2002 for use by the Bellevue Police Department and later approved as the new city hall."}}
