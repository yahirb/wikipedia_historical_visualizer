{"San_Antonio": {"Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio": "The Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio (Roman Rite) encompasses 27,841 square miles (72,110 km2) in the US state of Texas.\nThe archdiocese includes the city of San Antonio and the following counties: Val Verde, Edwards, Kerr, Gillespie, Kendall, Comal, Guadalupe, Gonzales, Uvalde, Kinney, Medina, Bexar, Wilson, Karnes, Frio, Atascosa, and the portion of McMullen north of the Nueces River.\nOn August 28, 1874, the Catholic Diocese of Galveston was divided and the northern territory was canonically erected by the Holy See as the diocese of San Antonio. Originally part of the Ecclesiastical Province of New Orleans, it was subsequently elevated on August 3, 1926, to a metropolitan archdiocese.\nThe archbishop of San Antonio also serves as the Metropolitan of the ecclesiastical province of San Antonio with the Archdiocese of San Antonio overseeing the following suffragan dioceses: Amarillo, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Laredo, Lubbock, and San Angelo. All of Texas' dioceses had been suffragan sees under San Antonio until December 2004 when Pope John Paul II created the new Ecclesiastical Province of Galveston-Houston and elevated the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston to a Metropolitan See."}}
