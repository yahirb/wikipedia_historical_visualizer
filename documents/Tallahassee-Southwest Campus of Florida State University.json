{"Tallahassee": {"Southwest Campus of Florida State University": "The FSU Southwest Campus (SWC) of Florida State University (FSU) is located in Tallahassee about a mile to the southwest of the Main Campus on approximately 740 acres (3.0 km2) remaining out of a large parcel often called \"The Farm\", a nickname derived from a dairy farm that once operated on the site. Over the years portions of The Farm have been converted to other uses, such as housing, research, golf, mass media and academics.\nThe Southwest campus includes the FSU Foundation and Research buildings, College of Engineering and the new Advanced Materials Research building."}}
