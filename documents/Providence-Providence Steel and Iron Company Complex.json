It consists of five one and two-story buildings, built between 1902 and 1951 for the Providence Steel and Iron Company (PS&I), whose corporate lineage begins with the Providence-based Builders Iron Foundry (BIF) in 1822. BIF purchased the land on Sims Avenue in 1902 to replace old facilities on Codding Street."}}
