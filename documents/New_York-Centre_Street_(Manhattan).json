{"New_York": {"Centre Street (Manhattan)": "Centre Street runs north\u2013south in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Centre Street runs from Park Row, through Chinatown, and continues north to Spring Street, where it merges with Lafayette Street. North of Reade Street, Centre Street is northbound-only (south of Reade Street, to the Brooklyn Bridge, Centre Street is two-way).\nFrom Colonial times until the 19th century, it bordered the site of the Collect Pond, a body of fresh water that was the nascent city's primary supply of drinking water, covering approximately 48 acres (194,000 m\u00b2) and running as deep as 50 feet (15 m). The pond was located just north of today's Foley Square and just west of modern Chinatown. It has since been drained and converted into a city park.\nIn colloquial usage, \"Centre Street\" may refer to the several courts or government offices along the street in the vicinity of Foley Square. 1 Centre Street is the Manhattan Municipal Building, 40 Centre Street is the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse (home of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit), 60 and 80 Centre Street are the civil division of the New York County Supreme Court, and 100 Centre Street is the criminal division of the New York County Supreme Court. That courthouse lent its address to a short-lived TV show of the same name. The courthouse is also home to the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, although its entrance is at 1 Hogan Place. 111 Centre Street is the New York City Civil Court. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is at 125 Worth Street, at the corner of Centre Street. Farther north, 240 Centre Street was the headquarters of the New York Police Department from 1909 until 1973; it is now residential. Additionally, the Museum of Chinese in America is located at 215 Centre Street, in Chinatown."}}
