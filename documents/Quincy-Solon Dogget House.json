{"Quincy": {"Solon Dogget House": "The Solon Dogget House is a historic house at 50 Union Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1872 by Henry G. Pratt, who sold it to Solon Dogget, a poet and artist. It is a well-preserved local example of Second Empire style, with a mansard roof, patterned shingling on the walls, and Queen Anne porches with spindled friezes and turned posts."}}
