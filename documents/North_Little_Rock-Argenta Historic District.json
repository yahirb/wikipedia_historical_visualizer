{"North_Little_Rock": {"Argenta Historic District": "The Argenta Historic District encompasses significant historic elements of central North Little Rock, Arkansas. The area that is now central North Little Rock was known as Argenta when it was first settled, and remained unincorporated until it was annexed to Little Rock in 1890. William Faucette, a leading Argenta politician and businessman, orchestrated the incorporation of North Little Rock just beyond the annexed area in 1901, and then made a successful petition to separate Argenta from Little Rock into the new municipality in 1903."}}
