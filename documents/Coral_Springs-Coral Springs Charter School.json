{"Coral_Springs": {"Coral Springs Charter School": "Coral Springs Charter School was established in 1999 in Coral Springs, Florida. The school was originally constructed in 1977 as an enclosed mall. When the mall failed, the nearly vacant structure was purchased by Charter Schools USA and converted into a combination school, serving students in grades 6 through 12. For the past nine years, Coral Springs Charter School has received an \"A\" grade under Florida's A+ Program, which measures student performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. The high school portion also currently utilizes Block Scheduling while the middle school portion uses a double rotating schedule."}}
