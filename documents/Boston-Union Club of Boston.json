{"Boston": {"Union Club of Boston": "The Union Club of Boston, founded in 1863, is one of the oldest gentlemen's clubs in the United States. It is located on Beacon Hill, adjacent to the Massachusetts State House. The clubhouse at No. 8 Park Street overlooks the Boston Common, and has views of the Common itself, Boston's historic Back Bay, and the hills to the city's west.\nThe Union Club was formed by members of another prominent Boston gentlemen's club, the Somerset Club, after disagreement over support (or lack thereof) for the Union cause during the American Civil War. During the Civil War, members of the Somerset Club split along political lines. In response, Somerset defectors formed the Union Club, which demanded \u201cunqualified loyalty to the constitution and the Union of our United States, and unwavering support of the Federal Government in effort for the suppression of the rebellion.\u201d\nThe club is a meeting place for prominent individuals from business and the professions."}}
