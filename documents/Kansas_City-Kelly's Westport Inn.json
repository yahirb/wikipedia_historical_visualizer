{"Kansas_City": {"Kelly's Westport Inn": "Kelly's Westport Inn is a famous drinking establishment in Westport, Kansas City, Missouri, constructed around 1850.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe grandson of Daniel Boone, Albert Gallatin Boone [1], operated a grocery there for a time. While some people believe that for a time, a tunnel running south connecting to a stable was part of the Underground Railroad[2] helping slaves escape to the North (primarily Kansas, which is only one mile west), and that the tunnel still exists, running under the street to the stable, which is now also a drinking establishment called the Westport Saloon, Kyle Kelly (one of the Kelly brothers who own the establishment) himself says, \"There are many tales of our old building and this is one of the more common ones."}}
