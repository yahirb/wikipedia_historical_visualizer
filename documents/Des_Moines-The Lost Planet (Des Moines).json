{"Des_Moines": {"The Lost Planet (Des Moines)": "The Lost Planet, in Des Moines, Iowa was the former dumping site for lime filtered out of the water supply by the Des Moines Water Works. It is located in the middle of Waterworks Park in central Des Moines. During dry stints, the surface of the site would become cracked and take on an other-worldly look, hence the name."}}
