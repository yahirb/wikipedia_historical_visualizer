{"Augusta-Richmond_County": {"1995 Masters Tournament": "The 1995 Masters Tournament was the 59th Masters Tournament, held April 6\u20139 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Ben Crenshaw won his second Masters championship, one stroke ahead of runner-up Davis Love III. It was an emotional victory for Crenshaw as it came just days after the death of his mentor, Harvey Penick. Crenshaw and Tom Kite attended the funeral in Texas on Wednesday and did not return to Augusta until that night, on the eve of the first round."}}
