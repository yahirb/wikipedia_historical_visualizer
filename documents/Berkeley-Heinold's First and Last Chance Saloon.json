Heinold in 1883 on Jack London Square in Oakland, California, United States. The name \"First and Last Chance\" refers to the time in which for many sailors, the pub was the first and last chance to drink alcohol heavily before or after a long voyage.\nHeinold's First and Last Chance is also known as \"Jack London's Rendezvous\", as it was the inspiration for scenes from the Oakland writer's novels Call of the Wild and The Sea Wolf."}}
