{"Salinas": {"Fort Ord": "Fort Ord is a former United States Army post on Monterey Bay of the Pacific Ocean coast in California, which closed in 1994 due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. Most of the fort's land now makes up the Fort Ord National Monument, managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Conservation Lands, while a small portion remains an active military installation under Army control designated as the Ord Military Community.\nBefore construction and official designation as a fort in 1940, the land was used as a maneuver area and field-artillery target range during 1917."}}
