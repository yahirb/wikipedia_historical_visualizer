{"Columbia": {"Rock Bridge Memorial State Park": "Rock Bridge Memorial State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Missouri consisting of 2,272.83 acres (919.78 ha) located in Boone County approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) south of Columbia, Missouri. The park is noted for its excellent examples of karst landforms including the rock bridge, sinkholes, and an underground stream at the cave known as Devil's Icebox. The rock bridge was created by the collapse of a section of a cave which resulted in a small arch of rock being left to form a natural bridge over the creek."}}
