{"Clifton": {"New Jersey's 9th congressional district": "New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District is a district that consists largely of Bergen County and Passaic County municipalities. Due to redistricting following the 2010 Census, parts of the old 9th District were shifted to the Fifth District and the new Eighth District, as part of a reduction in congressional districts from 13 to 12 in New Jersey.\nThe Ninth District is represented by Democrat Bill Pascrell, who resides in Paterson."}}
