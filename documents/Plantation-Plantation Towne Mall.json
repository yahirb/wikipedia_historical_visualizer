{"Plantation": {"Plantation Towne Mall": "The Plantation Towne Mall was an enclosed shopping mall in Plantation, Florida, which was destroyed by a fire on September 6, 1996. The shopping mall originally opened in 1968 as an open-air shopping plaza with a Publix Supermarket on its west end, and a Rite Aid Drug Store (vacant space during the fire) and movie theater (called Towne Theatre, but later Art Towne Twin until closing) on its east. In 1971, the center was enclosed by a metal roof, while original roofing was not removed."}}
