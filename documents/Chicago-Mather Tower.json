{"Chicago": {"Mather Tower": "Mather Tower (later Lincoln Tower, as designated on the Michigan\u2013Wacker Historic District roster; now identified primarily by its address) is a Neo-Gothic, terra cotta-clad high-rise structure in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is located at 75 East Wacker Drive in the downtown \"loop\" area, adjacent to the Chicago River.\nThe 521-foot-high building is sometimes called \"The Inverted Spyglass\" by Chicagoans due to its highly unusual design, a 18-story octagonal tower atop a more conventional 24-story rectangular \"box.\" Briefly the tallest building in Chicago at the time of its completion in 1928, it remains the city's most slender high-rise structure at only 100 by 65 feet at its base."}}
