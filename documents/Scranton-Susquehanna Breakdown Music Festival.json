{"Scranton": {"Susquehanna Breakdown Music Festival": "The Susquehanna Breakdown Music Festival, formerly known as The Old Farmer's Ball, is a one-day music festival held at the Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The focus of the festival centers around the arts and spans musical genres including folk, Americana, roots, and bluegrass. The festival began in 2013 when Cabinet, a prominent regional band in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and Live Nation Entertainment started the festival to bring attention to not only their musical genre, but also to regional artists, farmers and craftsmen, who showcased and sold their wares throughout the festival."}}
