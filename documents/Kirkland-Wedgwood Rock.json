{"Kirkland": {"Wedgwood Rock": "Wedgwood Rock is a glacial erratic (and known to geologists as the Wedgwood Erratic) near the neighborhood of Wedgwood in Seattle, Washington. (Technically, the rock is outside the boundary of Wedgwood, in the Bryant/Ravenna neighborhoods.) Its mineral composition matches that of Mount Erie, on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, Washington, 55 mi (89 km) north. Prior to the establishment of the Wedgwood neighborhood, the erratic was known first as Lone Rock and later simply as Big Rock."}}
