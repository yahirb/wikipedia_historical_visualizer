{"Los_Angeles": {"International Savings & Exchange Bank Building": "The International Savings & Exchange Bank Building (also known as the International Savings Building), was built in the Spring Street Financial District of Los Angeles in 1907. Standing ten floors, it was designed in the Renaissance Revival and Italianate styles by architect H. Alban Reaves (some sources spell Reeves), who had previously designed several structures in New York, including what is now the south building of the historic Schuyler Arms.\nIt stood at 226 North Spring Street, the intersection of Temple and Spring (sometimes referred to as Temple Square) across from the Main Post Office, and was featured in several postcards from the 1920s. Occupying the ground floor was the International Savings & Exchange Bank, \u201can institution much in favor among foreign born and descended residents,\u201d which had been incorporated four years earlier in 1903.\n\nIn 1928, the building was dwarfed by the new 30-story Los Angeles City Hall, and soon after calls for its demolition increased, resulting in its razing sometime after 1954. The portion of Spring Street that its front entrance faced no longer exists."}}
