{"Baltimore": {"Research Institute for Advanced Studies": "The Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States, is an independent, postdoctoral research center for theoretical research and intellectual inquiry founded in 1930 by American educator Abraham Flexner, together with philanthropists Louis Bamberger and Caroline Bamberger Fuld.\nThe IAS is perhaps best known as the academic home of Albert Einstein, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann and Kurt G\u00f6del, after their immigration to the United States. Although it is close to and collaborates with Princeton University, Rutgers University, and other nearby institutions, it is independent and does not charge tuition or fees."}}
