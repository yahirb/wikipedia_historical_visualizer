{"Honolulu": {"James L. Coke House": "The James L. Coke House, also called Waipuna ('springwater' in the Hawaiian language), at 3649 Nu\u02bbuanu Pali Drive in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi was built in 1934 for Judge James L. Coke, who had that year been reappointed Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its architecture is significant as an example of the residential work of C.W. Dickey, the most prominent local architect of the period, and its landscaping represents the work of the preeminent landscape architect of the period, Richard Tongg. The house and grounds were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986."}}
