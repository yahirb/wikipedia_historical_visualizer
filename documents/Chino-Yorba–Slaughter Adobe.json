{"Chino": {"Yorba\u2013Slaughter Adobe": "The Yorba\u2013Slaughter Adobe is a historic adobe house located at 17127 Pomona Rincon Road near Chino, California. Built in the early 1850s, the adobe is typical of the building style prevalent during and around California's period of Mexican governance. Raimundo Yorba built the adobe on land thought to be part of Rancho El Rincon, a land grant owned by his father, Bernardo Yorba; however, a later survey determined the adobe was not part of the rancho."}}
