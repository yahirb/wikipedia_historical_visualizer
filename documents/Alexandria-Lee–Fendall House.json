{"Alexandria": {"Lee\u2013Fendall House": "The Lee\u2013Fendall House is a historic house museum and garden located in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. Since its construction in 1785 the house has served as home to thirty-seven members of the Lee family (1785\u20131903), hundreds of convalescing Union soldiers (1863\u20131865), the prominent Downham family (1903\u20131937), and powerful labor leader John L. Lewis (1937\u20131969).\nThe 1785 house, standing on its original half-acre lot, is in the vernacular \"telescopic style\" of architecture similar to many Maryland homes, but not found elsewhere in northern Virginia."}}
