{"Chesapeake": {"Great Bridge, Virginia": "Great Bridge is a community located in the independent city of Chesapeake in the U.S. state of Virginia. Its name is derived from the American Revolutionary War Battle of Great Bridge, which took place on December 9, 1775 and resulted in the final removal of British government from the Colony and Dominion of Virginia. Near the end of the war, the Hudgins family moved to Great Bridge and established the first permanent settlement in the area."}}
