{"Trenton": {"Hog Island Cranes": "The Hog Island Cranes in Trenton, New Jersey are two of twenty-eight locomotive steam gantry cranes built in 1917 by the McMyler-Interstate Company of Cleveland, Ohio for the Hog Island, Philadelphia shipyard. They aided in the American war effort in World War One, are representative of an important era of heavy lifting equipment, and played an important role in 20th century waterfront technology. The two cranes now in Trenton were sold as government surplus in 1930 to the city of Trenton for $5000, a fifth of the original cost, and were installed at the Trenton Marine Terminal in 1932."}}
