{"Gary": {"Carlson Oxbow Park": "Carlson Oxbow Park is an 89-acre nature park located in the Hessville neighborhood of Hammond, Indiana, along the north bank of the Little Calumet River and immediately south of the Borman Expressway. It takes its name from a sharp bend in the Little Calumet that was left behind when the river was straightened in the 20th century, forming an oxbow lake.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was first purchased in 1964 for flood control, but the river was straightened in 1975 forming the oxbow."}}
