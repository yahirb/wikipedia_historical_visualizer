{"Cedar_Rapids": {"Cedar Rapids Public Library": "The Cedar Rapids Public Library (CRPL) serves the city of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It consists of two locations: the Ladd Library, located at 3750 Williams Blvd SW, and the Downtown Library, located at 450 5th Avenue SE. The CRPL works in cooperation with the Marion Public Library and Hiawatha Public Library to form the Metro Library Network, which allows them to share a collection of materials, partner on programs, and make resources more available to all citizens.\nThe Iowa flood of 2008, considered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to be \"one of the worst and most costly floods in Iowa--and even U.S. history,\" destroyed the building at the previous downtown location of the main branch, along with over half of the library's collection."}}
