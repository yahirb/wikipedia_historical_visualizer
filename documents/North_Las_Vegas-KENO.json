{"North_Las_Vegas": {"KENO": "Keno  is a lottery-like gambling game often played at modern casinos, and also offered as a game in some lotteries.\n\nPlayers wager by choosing numbers ranging from 1 through (usually) 80. After all players make their wagers, 20 numbers (some variants draw fewer numbers) are drawn at random, either with a ball machine similar to ones used for lotteries and bingo, or with a random number generator."}}
