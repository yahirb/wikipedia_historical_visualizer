{"Greenville": {"Geneva Reformed Seminary": "Geneva Reformed Seminary is a small theological school in Greenville, South Carolina accredited by the Association of Reformed Theological Seminaries and supported by the Free Presbyterian Church of North America. The seminary offers a B.D. and an M.Div. Initially called Whitefield College of the Bible after a companion school in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, the seminary was renamed in 2002 to avoid confusion in the United States where Bible schools and seminaries prepare students at different academic levels."}}
