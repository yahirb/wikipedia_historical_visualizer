{"Schenectady": {"Dudley Observatory": "Dudley Observatory is an astronomical observatory originally located in Albany, New York, and now in Schenectady, New York. The Observatory was chartered on February 11, 1852 by the New York State Senate, and by the New York State Assembly on April 3, 1852. While Dudley no longer serves as an operating observatory, it remains the oldest non-academic institution of astronomical research in America."}}
