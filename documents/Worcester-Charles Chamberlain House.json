{"Worcester": {"Charles Chamberlain House": "The Charles Chamberlain House was a historic house at 373 Pleasant Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1876, it was one of the city's finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture, with spindled bargeboard in its gables, vertical board siding, a porch supported by delicate turned posts with foliate capitals, and decorated gable aprons. Charles Chamberlain, the first recorded owner, was the owner of a blade manufacturing firm."}}
