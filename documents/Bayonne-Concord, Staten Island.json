{"Bayonne": {"Concord, Staten Island": "Concord is a neighborhood located in the borough of Staten Island in New York City, New York, United States.\n\nLocated in northeastern Staten Island, and bordered by the neighborhoods of Grasmere, Clifton, Dongan Hills, Emerson Hill, and Old Town, Concord was named Dutch Farms originally, but was renamed in 1845 after Concord, Massachusetts as a consequence of that town's historical significance. Early residents of Concord included Judge William Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson and for whom nearby Emerson Hill is named) and Henry David Thoreau."}}
