{"Cincinnati": {"National Underground Railroad Freedom Center": "The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is a museum in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio based on the history of the Underground Railroad. Opened in 2004, the Center also pays tribute to all efforts to \"abolish human enslavement and secure freedom for all people.\"\nIt is one of a new group of \"museums of conscience\" in the United States, along with the Museum of Tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Civil Rights Museum. The Center offers insight into the struggle for freedom in the past, in the present, and for the future, as it attempts to challenge visitors to contemplate the meaning of freedom in their own lives."}}
