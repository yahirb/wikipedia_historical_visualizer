{"Pawtucket": {"Allenville Mill Storehouse": "Allenville Mill Storehouse (also known as Company Storehouse or Allenville) is a historic mill storehouse at 5 Esmond Street in Esmond, Rhode Island within the town of Smithfield, Rhode Island. The exact date of construction is unknown, but it was built with rubble-construction as was typical of mill construction during and after the War of 1812. In 1813, Phillip Allen purchased 4.5 acres of land and constructed a mill on the site, but the first specific record to refer to the storehouse was an insurance policy from 1836."}}
