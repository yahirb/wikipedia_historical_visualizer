{"Boston": {"Pi Alley (Boston)": "Pi Alley (often misspelled Pie Alley) in Boston, Massachusetts, is located off Washington Street, near the Old City Hall on School Street. The origin of the short street's name remains in question. It may be called \"Pi Alley\" \"because of the dumping into it of the pied type from newspaper composing rooms years ago,\" or \"Pie Alley\" \"because of restaurants that sold a piece of pie and a cup of coffee for a nickel.\" It is also known as Williams Court, Savage's Court, Peck's Arch, and Webster's Arch."}}
