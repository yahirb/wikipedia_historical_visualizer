{"Miami_Beach": {"5th Street Gym": "The 5th Street Gym is a boxing gym in Miami Beach, Florida, and the site of a historic run of championship fighters who trained there from the early 1950s until today. The gym was dormant from 1992-2009 due to Chris Dundee and Angelo Dundee's retirement. In 2009 the gym re-opened at the original location with Angelo Dundee, Tom Tsatas and Dino Spencer."}}
