{"Evanston": {"Mountain Moving Coffeehouse": "The Mountain Moving Coffeehouse for Womyn and Children was a nationally known lesbian-feminist music venue located in various north side Chicago neighborhoods. It operated for thirty-one consecutive years, from 1974 until 2005. The name of the organization evokes the political task that feminists must \"move the mountains\" of institutional sexism and homophobia."}}
