{"Los_Angeles": {"Silver Lake, Los Angeles": "Silver Lake is a residential and commercial neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. Originally named Ivanhoe in the 1900s by a resident from Scotland, it was built around what was then a city reservoir which gives the district its name. The \"Silver\" in Silver Lake is not because of the water's color, but named for a local politician who helped create the reservoir."}}
