{"New_York": {"New York Law Institute": "The New York Law Institute is the oldest circulating law library in New York City and is open to contributing members of the New York Bar, as well as to scholars of history and the law.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins (1828 \u2013 1854) ===\nIn 1876, The Report on Libraries of the United States described the New York Law Institute Library as \u201cthe best public law library in this country,\u201d and a success in the highest and broadest sense \u2026.\u201d  The Institute and its library were the result of the efforts of two young lawyers, George Sullivan and James W. Gerard, to break up the so-called \u201cbarrister ring\u201d of twelve to fifteen lawyers who with the connivance of the judiciary monopolized all the worthwhile legal business in the circuit and supreme court, and the court of chancery during the mid-1820s.  They achieved one of their goals when the legislature established the Superior Court in 1828, but they believed that to break up the ring for good, the establishment of a \u201cLaw Association\u201d was essential."}}
