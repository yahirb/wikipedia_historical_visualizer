{"New_York": {"1 New York Place": "1 New York Place was a supertall skyscraper that was proposed in 2002 to rise 1,050 feet (320 m) tall and have 90 floors. The tower was supposed to be located in New York City's financial district at Broadway and Fulton Street, but the project was canceled.\nThe tower was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and projected to cost USD $680 million. It would have had 1.3 million square feet (121,000 square meters) of floor space. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority would have been a partner with their proposed transit hub at the location."}}
