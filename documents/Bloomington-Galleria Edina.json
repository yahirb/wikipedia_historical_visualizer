This mall is located directly across the street from America's first enclosed mall, Southdale Center, which originally opened in 1956.\nIn 2004, the Galleria Edina garnered attention in the shopping centre industry by implementing the then-novel idea of an electronic gift registry where registrants may specify items from multiple merchants at the center."}}
