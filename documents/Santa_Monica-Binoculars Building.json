{"Santa_Monica": {"Binoculars Building": "The Binoculars Building, originally the Chiat/Day Building, is a commercial building located in Venice, Los Angeles, California, which incorporates the public artwork \"Giant Binoculars\" by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen on its street-facing facade. Built between 1991 and 2001 for advertising agency Chiat/Day (now TBWA\\Chiat\\Day) as its West Coast corporate headquarters, it was designed by Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry, and was his last project in Los Angeles until the Walt Disney Concert Hall began construction in 1999.\nThe building is notable for the three different styles used in the main facade on Main Street, particularly the massive \"Giant Binoculars\" sculpture covering both a car and pedestrian entrance."}}
