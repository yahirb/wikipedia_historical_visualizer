{"Alexandria": {"Belvale": "Belvale is an historic house in present-day Fairfax County, Virginia built between 1763 and 1766 by George Johnston (1700-1766), member of the Virginia Assembly 1758-1766, friend of Patrick Henry, and legal advisor to George Washington, who was a frequent visitor to the home. The home's original lands, described as lying on \"Doeg's Run\", were first granted on July 6, 1698 to Richard Carpenter, who bequeathed them in 1750 to his wife Mary and daughter Ann, who sold the property to Johnston in 1763. Belvale is sometimes called \"Belle Vale Manor\" in historical records."}}
