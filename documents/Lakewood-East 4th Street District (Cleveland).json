{"Lakewood": {"East 4th Street District (Cleveland)": "East 4th Street is a major downtown district in Cleveland, Ohio, known for its food, entertainment, and lack of car traffic. The street runs south from Euclid Avenue to Prospect Avenue. Once a very run down street, the area has been given new life by a multitude of restaurateurs, investors, small business owners and the city of Cleveland itself."}}
