{"North_Miami": {"Arch Creek, Florida": "Arch Creek was an early settlement in Miami-Dade County, Florida, in present-day metropolitan Miami. Tequesta Indians thrived here before the first Europeans arrived in the early 16th century. The name is derived from the natural limestone bridge spanning 40 feet (12 m) across the creek."}}
