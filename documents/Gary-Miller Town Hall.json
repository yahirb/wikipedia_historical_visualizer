{"Gary": {"Miller Town Hall": "The Miller Town Hall is a two-story brick building in the Miller Beach community in Gary, Indiana, in the United States. It was constructed to serve as the administrative building for the town of Miller, incorporated in 1907, and was used for that purpose until Miller's annexation into Gary in 1918. It later served as a fire station through much of the 20th century, and is currently used for storage only."}}
