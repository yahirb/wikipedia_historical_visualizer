{"New_Britain": {"West End Historic District (New Britain, Connecticut)": "The West End Historic District encompasses a predominantly residential area west of downtown New Britain, Connecticut. Forming a rough C shape around the west part of Walnut Hill Park, the area was developed in the late 19th century as one of its premier upper-class neighborhoods, home to business and civic leaders, with a fine array of late 19th and early 20th century architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."}}
