{"Waltham": {"Milestone (Arlington, Massachusetts)": "This Milestone, carved in 1790, is a historic milestone at the intersection of Appleton Street and Paul Revere Road in Arlington, Massachusetts. It denotes the point at which the historic road from Boston to Concord, Massachusetts was 8 miles (13 km) from Boston. The road was realigned (to roughly the current alignment of Massachusetts Avenue) in 1811, bypassing the marker."}}
