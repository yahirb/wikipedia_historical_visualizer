{"Missoula": {"Dornblaser Field": "Dornblaser Field is the name of two outdoor athletic stadiums in the western United States, located in Missoula, Montana. Both were former home fields of the University of Montana Grizzlies football teams and were named for Paul Dornblaser, a captain of the football team in 1912 who was killed in World War I. Both stadiums had conventional north-south orientations at an approximate elevation of 3,200 feet (980 m) above sea level.\nThe first ivy-covered stone venue opened 106 years ago in 1912 on campus at the base of Mount Sentinel and east of University Hall."}}
