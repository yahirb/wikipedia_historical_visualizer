{"Akron": {"Bulger Hall": "James Joseph \"Whitey\" Bulger Jr. (; born September 3, 1929) is an American former organized crime boss of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston, Massachusetts. Federal prosecutors indicted Bulger for nineteen murders based on grand jury testimony from Kevin Weeks and other former associates. Bulger is the brother of William M. Bulger, former President of the Massachusetts Senate.\nAccording to the FBI, Bulger served as a confidential informant for the Bureau beginning in 1975, a claim Bulger denies. However, as a result, the FBI largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the rival Italian-American Patriarca crime family. Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger. For the FBI especially, this caused great embarrassment. Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding on December 23, 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler, John Connolly, about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). For sixteen years, he remained at large. For twelve of those years, Bulger was on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.\nOn June 22, 2011, Bulger was arrested outside an apartment in Santa Monica, California. Arrested with him was his long-time girlfriend Catherine Greig. Bulger was 81 years old at the time. Soon after, Bulger and Greig were extradited to Massachusetts and taken under heavy guard to John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse on Boston Harbor, which had to be partially closed for their arrival. Greig pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud, and conspiracy to commit identity fraud and was sentenced to eight years in prison in June 2012. Bulger did not seek bail and remained in custody at the Plymouth County House of Correction in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\nOn June 12, 2013, Bulger went on trial for 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, and weapons charges, including complicity in nineteen murders. On August 12, he was found guilty on 31 counts, including both racketeering charges, and was found to have been involved in eleven murders. On November 14, he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus five years for his crimes by U.S. District Judge Denise Casper. Bulger is now inmate number 02182-748, currently incarcerated for life at the United States Penitentiary Coleman II in Sumterville, Florida."}}
