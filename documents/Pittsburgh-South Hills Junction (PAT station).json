{"Pittsburgh": {"South Hills Junction (PAT station)": "South Hills Junction is a station on the Port Authority of Allegheny County's light rail network. This station served as the original \"merge point\" of the inbound Beechview and Overbrook branches of the light rail system, just before the run under Mount Washington through the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel and into downtown Pittsburgh. In 1993 the Overbrook (Blue) Line was shut down for complete reconstruction to serve the modern-day light rail cars."}}
