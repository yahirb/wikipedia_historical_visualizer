{"Lansing": {"Eustace Hall": "Eustace Hall located on Laboratory Row is the only building on Michigan State University's main campus in East Lansing, Michigan that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed in a mix of \"Queen Anne massing, Richardsonian Romanesque features, and Shingle Style\", it was built in 1888 as the Horticultural Laboratory Building. Its design has been variously attributed to noted MSU alumnus and noted horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey and to Lansing architect William Appleyard It housed the horticulture department until 1924 when a new horticulture building (now known as Old Horticulture) was opened."}}
