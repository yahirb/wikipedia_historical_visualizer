{"Baton_Rouge": {"KLSU": "KLSU (91.1 FM) is the student-run college radio station for Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a radio format of variety music and specialty programming. The radio station is part of the university's Student Media Program and employs students as DJs and management staff. KLSU broadcasts across the Baton Rouge area at 23,000 watts of power, and is able to reach up to 40 miles beyond the LSU campus. The station is licensed under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as a non-commercial educational (NCE) radio station. KLSU is one of 700 college radio stations across the United States that submits music chart reports to the weekly publication College Music Journal magazine.\nKLSU is unusual in that its callsign begins with a K but is located on the east side on the Mississippi River (which should have it beginning with a W), and the callsign was not the beneficiary of the FCC grandfather clause. During the application period for the station, it was discovered that another station had the desired callsign (WLSU). Since the station was located within a mile of the Mississippi River, the FCC granted an exemption to the K-W rule so it could have LSU in its callsign.\nIn April 2016, KLSU significantly upgraded their power from 5,700 watts class A to 23,000 watts class C3."}}
