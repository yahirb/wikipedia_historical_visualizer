{"Alameda": {"Intertribal Friendship House": "The Intertribal Friendship House (IFH) of Oakland is one of the oldest Indian-focused urban resource and community organizations in the United States. Founded in 1955, IFH was created by local residents, similarly to American Indian Center in Chicago. Beginning in 1952, the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) supported a plan to relocate American Indians to urban areas, further encouraged by the Indian Relocation Act of 1956."}}
