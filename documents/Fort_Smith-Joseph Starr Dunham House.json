{"Fort_Smith": {"Joseph Starr Dunham House": "The Joseph Starr Dunham House is a historic house at 418 Broadway in Van Buren, Arkansas. Built c. 1870, this 1-1/2 story wood frame house is a fine local example of Gothic Revival architecture, with a steeply-pitched side-gable roof that has front-facing gable dormers decorated with sawn woodwork, and a full-width front porch with spiral posts and delicate brackets."}}
