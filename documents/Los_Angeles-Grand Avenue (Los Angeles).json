{"Los_Angeles": {"Grand Avenue (Los Angeles)": "Grand Avenue is a major north-south thoroughfare in Los Angeles, California. In 2007, a $3 billion Grand Avenue Project was proposed to revive Downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally called Charity Street (or Calle de la Caridad in Spanish), it is located just east of Hope Street, but contrary to myth, there was never a corresponding Faith Street, representing the trinity of virtue, \"Faith, Hope and Charity.\" Olive Street (or Calle de Aceituna in Spanish) is situated to the east of Grand Street instead."}}
