{"Chattanooga": {"Raccoon Mountain Caverns": "Raccoon Mountain Caverns was opened in 1929 by Leo Lambert, a local caver. The property was owned by the Grand Hotel and used as a farm for their restaurant. On hot afternoons, it was said that the farmers would relax in front of several cracks in the rock at the base of the mountain and enjoy the cool air that was blowing out."}}
