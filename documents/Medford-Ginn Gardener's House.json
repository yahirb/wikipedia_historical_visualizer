{"Medford": {"Ginn Gardener's House": "The Ginn Gardener's House is a historic house at 22 Ginn Road in Winchester, Massachusetts. It is one of two surviving outbuildings (the other is the carriage house) of the extensive \"Terrace of Oaks\" estate of publisher Edwin Ginn, whose main house was demolished in 1946. The two-story brick gardener's house, built in 1900, shows the high quality of the estate and its Georgian Revival character."}}
