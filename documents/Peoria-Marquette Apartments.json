{"Peoria": {"Marquette Apartments": "Marquette Apartments is a historic apartment building located at 701 Main Street in Peoria, Illinois. The building was built in 1924 to help meet the need for housing in downtown Peoria, as the number of downtown workers looking for housing near their jobs was growing rapidly. Peoria architects Hewitt & Emerson designed the apartments; while the firm was known for its classically inspired designs, they produced a more modern design for the building."}}
