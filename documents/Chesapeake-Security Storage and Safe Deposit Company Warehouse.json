{"Chesapeake": {"Security Storage and Safe Deposit Company Warehouse": "The Security Storage and Safe Deposit Company Warehouse is a historic storage facility at 517-523 Front Street in Norfolk, Virginia. It is a large concrete structure with four levels of storage, and was built in 1916. It is a rare survivor in an area that once had many warehouses, and is distinctive for its subdued decorations, which differentiate it from otherwise nondescript brick or concrete warehouses."}}
