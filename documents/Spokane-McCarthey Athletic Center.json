{"Spokane": {"McCarthey Athletic Center": "McCarthey Athletic Center or \"MAC\" is a 6,000-seat indoor arena in the northwest United States, located on the campus of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Opened thirteen years ago in November 2004, it is home to the university's Bulldog basketball programs, members of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in Division I of the NCAA.\nOften called \"The New Kennel,\" its nickname was inherited from the school's former basketball arena, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, popularly known as \"The Kennel,\" which had been home to the Bulldogs for 39 years. As the MAC has become the established basketball arena on campus, more fans have begun calling it simply \"The Kennel,\" with the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre being known as the \"Martin Centre.\" The elevation of the court is approximately 1,900 feet (580 m) above sea level."}}
