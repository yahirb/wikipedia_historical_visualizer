{"Cleveland": {"IMG Center": "The IMG Center is a modernist styled 1965-built 180 foot 16 story high-rise in downtown Cleveland's Nine-Twelve District. It sits at the prominent Cleveland intersection of East Ninth and St. Clair. The building is named after the Cleveland founded firm International Management Group or IMG. There is a \"nub\" on top of the building that can be seen in all directions that bears the IMG logo. The distinctive look of the building is due its use of glass in its corners in lieu of solid corner supports. At the time of its construction the building cost $7 Million dollars and was considered a fine example of modernist skyscraper construction."}}
