{"Quincy": {"Brush Hill Historic District": "The Brush Hill Historic District is a residential historic district along Brush Hill Road in Milton, Massachusetts. It extends on the north side of the road from Dana Avenue to Brush Hill Lane, and on the south side from Bradlee Road to Robbins Street. Shortly before settlers migrated to Brush Hill in the 1650s, a significant forest fire struck the area causing trees to die and leaves to fall."}}
