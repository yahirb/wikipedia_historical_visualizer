{"Redding": {"Spring Creek Reservoir (California)": "The Spring Creek Reservoir is the artificial lake created by the construction of the Spring Creek Dam across Spring Creek in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest of Shasta County, California, adjacent to Keswick.\nThe reservoir is used mostly for flood control storage, and is rarely filled to its 5,870 acre\u22c5ft (7,240,000 m3) capacity. During the dry season, water from Spring Creek pools in a small, stagnant pond retained behind the dam, depositing contaminated sediment and acidic mine waste in the reservoir space."}}
