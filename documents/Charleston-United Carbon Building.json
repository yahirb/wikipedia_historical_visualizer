{"Charleston": {"United Carbon Building": "United Carbon Building, also known as Boulevard Tower, Stanley Building, and Nelson Building, is a historic office building located at Charleston, West Virginia. It is a 12-story, steel-framed building sheathed in a smooth, unornamented shell of gold-colored brick, black steel and glass. Its slender volume rises 157 feet from the sidewalk to the twelfth-floor penthouse, which once served as the office of the building's prominent patron, Oscar Nelson (1879-1953)."}}
