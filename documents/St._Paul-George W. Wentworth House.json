{"St._Paul": {"George W. Wentworth House": "The George W. Wentworth House is a large Queen Anne style home, that was built in 1887 in West Saint Paul in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Wentworth was an emigre from England who traded in horses; he was also involved in local politics, working to organize the city of South Saint Paul. In the late 1880s, a dispute arose between the farmers in the western portion of the city, whom Wentworth represented, and the people living around the stockyards in the eastern portion of the city."}}
