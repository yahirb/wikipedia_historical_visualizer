{"Iowa_City": {"Oakdale, Iowa": "Oakdale was an unincorporated rural residential village established in 1908 by the State of Iowa as a statewide treatment center for tuberculosis (TB) in rural Johnson County, located about five miles northwest of central Iowa City and now a part of Coralville, immediately adjacent to the community of North Liberty.\nThe site was chosen for its remoteness, its location along a railroad, and its proximity to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City.\n\nAs a partially self-sustaining community, Oakdale included a depot on the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRandIC) line, power plant, several residential patient and staff buildings, pharmacy, postal, and administrative units, as well as associated facilities to support varied farming operations intended to help sustain the institution, including a large dairy."}}
