{"Cranston": {"General Ice Cream Corporation Building": "The General Ice Cream Corporation Building is a historic industrial building at 485 Plainfield Street in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, United States. It is a brick building with two sections, one two stories and the other three. The two parts were built in separate stages between 1915 and 1918, occasioned by the rapid growth of the Dolbey Ice Cream Company, which was by 1921 the largest ice cream producer in the state."}}
