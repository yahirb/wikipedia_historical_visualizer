{"Madison": {"Agricultural Engineering Building": "Agricultural engineering is the engineering discipline that studies agricultural production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines the disciplines of mechanical, civil, electrical and chemical engineering principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles according to technological principles.\n\n\n== Specialties ==\nAgricultural engineers may engage in any of the following areas:\ndesign of agricultural machinery, equipment, and agricultural structures\ninternal combustion engines as applied to agricultural machinery\nagricultural resource management (including land use and water use)\nwater management, conservation, and storage for crop irrigation and livestock production\nsurveying and land profiling\nclimatology and atmospheric science\nsoil management and conservation, including erosion and erosion control\nseeding, tillage, harvesting, and processing of crops\nlivestock production, including poultry, fish, and dairy animals\nwaste management, including animal waste, agricultural residues, and fertilizer runoff\nfood engineering and the processing of agricultural products\nbasic principles of circuit analysis, as applied to electrical motors\nphysical and chemical properties of materials used in, or produced by, agricultural production\nbioresource engineering, which uses machines on the molecular level to help the environment."}}
