{"East_Orange": {"Cedar Street Subway": "The Cedar Street Subway is a tunnel in Newark that allowed street cars (and later buses) access to the subterranean level of the Newark Public Service Terminal. It was built by the Public Service Corporation in 1916, at the same time as the terminal building.\nDespite its use for streetcars, the term \"subway\" is not the typical transportation meaning of an underground rapid rail system."}}
