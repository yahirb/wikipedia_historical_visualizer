{"Atlanta": {"DuPre Excelsior Mill": "Located at 695 North Avenue in Atlanta, the Dupre Excelsior Mill (the actual name as of 1911 was \"Du Pree Manufacturing Company Excelsior Factory\"), may have been built as early as 1890 by DuPre (also spelled Du Pree) Manufacturing Company. However, the mill fails to appear on Atlanta city maps in 1892 and 1899, which both show the property as vacant. The first possible reference to the mill exist in the report of the death of Hubert Neal on July 17, 1899."}}
