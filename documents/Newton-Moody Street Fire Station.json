{"Newton": {"Moody Street Fire Station": "The Moody Street Fire Station is a historic fire station at 533 Moody Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. Built in 1890, it is one of two nearly identical fire stations designed by local architect Captain Samuel Patch. (The other is the central fire station on Lexington Street, listed in the Central Square Historic District.) It was built during the South Side's rapid development due to the growth of the Waltham Watch Company, and is an excellent example of Queen Anne/Romanesque Revival styling."}}
