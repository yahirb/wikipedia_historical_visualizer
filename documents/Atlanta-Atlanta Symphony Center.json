{"Atlanta": {"Atlanta Symphony Center": "Symphony Center was a proposed concert hall in Atlanta, Georgia that would have been the new home of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The site for the new structure was to be in Midtown on 14th Street just south of the current Symphony Hall in the Woodruff Arts Center. Architect Santiago Calatrava was selected to design the facility and delivered a design that would serve as a \"postcard\" for the city."}}
