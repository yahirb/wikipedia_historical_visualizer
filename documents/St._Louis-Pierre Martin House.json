{"St._Louis": {"Pierre Martin House": "The Pierre Martin House is a French Colonial House located at the intersection of First Street and Old Route 3 in North Dupo, Illinois. The house, one of the oldest in Illinois, was built circa 1790 in what was at the time the French village of Pierre du Pont, which was established during a wave of French settlement in southwestern Illinois. It is one of six surviving poteaux-sur-sol buildings in Illinois and the only one owned by an upper-middle-class individual."}}
