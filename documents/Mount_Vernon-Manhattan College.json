{"Mount_Vernon": {"Manhattan College": "Manhattan College is a private, independent, Roman Catholic, liberal arts college located in the Bronx, New York City, United States. After originally being established in 1853 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools (De La Salle Christian Brothers) as an academy for day students, Manhattan College was officially incorporated as an institution of higher education through a charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents. In 1922, the College moved from Manhattan to the Riverdale section of the Bronx, roughly 6.4 miles (10.3 km) north of its original location on 131st Street in the Manhattanville section of Manhattan."}}
