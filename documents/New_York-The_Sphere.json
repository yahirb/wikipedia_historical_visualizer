{"New_York": {"The Sphere": "The Sphere (officially Sphere at Plaza Fountain) is a 25 feet (7.6 m) high, cast bronze sculpture by German artist Fritz Koenig that is located in Liberty Park at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Originally located in the Austin J. Tobin Plaza, it survived the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers as a result of the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nHaving stood centrally in Austin J. Tobin Plaza between the twin towers, The Sphere was recovered from the rubble, visibly damaged but largely intact. After being dismantled and stored near a hangar at JFK airport, the sculpture was the subject of the 2001 documentary Koenig's Sphere. On March 11, 2002, six months after the attack, The Sphere was relocated to a temporary location in Battery Park, where in unrestored condition it was re-dedicated (September 11, 2002) with an eternal flame.\nHaving become a major tourist attraction, the unrestored sculpture was re-dedicated on August 16, 2017 by the Port Authority at a permanent location in Liberty Park, overlooking the September 11 Memorial and its original location."}}
