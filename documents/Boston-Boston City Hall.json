{"Boston": {"Boston City Hall": "Boston City Hall is the seat of city government of Boston, Massachusetts. It includes the offices of the mayor of Boston and the Boston City Council. The current hall was built in 1968 to assume the functions of the Old City Hall, and is a controversial and prominent example of the brutalist architectural style. It was designed by Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles (architects) with Campbell, Aldrich & Nulty (architects) and Lemessurier Associates (engineers). Together with the surrounding plaza, City Hall is part of the Government Center complex, a major urban redesign effort in the 1960s.\nThe building has been subject to near universal public condemnation, and is often called one of the world's ugliest buildings. Calls for the structure to be destroyed have been regular since before construction was finished. However, architects and critics considered it excellent work, with one poll finding architects describe Boston City Hall as one of the ten proudest achievements of American architecture."}}
