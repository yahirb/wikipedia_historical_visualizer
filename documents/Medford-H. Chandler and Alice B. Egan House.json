{"Medford": {"H. Chandler and Alice B. Egan House": "The H. Chandler and Alice B. Egan House is a historic house in Medford, Oregon, United States. Champion golfer and noted golf course architect Chandler Egan (1884\u20131936) designed it in the Arts and Crafts style soon after he relocated from Chicago to Medford during a temporary lull in his golf career. His involvement in golf course design grew naturally out of the fact that he was one of the few golf experts in the Pacific Northwest in that period."}}
