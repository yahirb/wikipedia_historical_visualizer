{"Bayonne": {"Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital": "The Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, also known as USPHS Hospital #43, was the United States\u2019 first public health hospital, opened in 1902 and operating as a hospital until 1930. Constructed in phases, the facility encompassed both a general hospital and a separate pavilion style contagious disease hospital. The hospital served as a detention facility for new immigrants who were deemed unfit to enter the United States after their arrival; immigrants would either be released from the hospital to go on to a new life in America or sent back to their home countries."}}
