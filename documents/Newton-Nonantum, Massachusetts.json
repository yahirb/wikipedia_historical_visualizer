{"Newton": {"Nonantum, Massachusetts": "Nonantum (from a Native American Algonquian word meaning \"blessing or prayer\") is one of the thirteen villages of Newton, Massachusetts, also known as Silver Lake or The Lake. The lake in question was filled with construction rubble and built over from the 1930s until its total demise in 1971. The neighborhood kids cleared the snow each winter and played hockey on it through the 1950s."}}
