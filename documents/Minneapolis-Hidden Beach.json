{"Minneapolis": {"Hidden Beach": "Hidden Beach is a beach on the east side of Cedar Lake in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The beach is notable for once being the only nude beach in the Twin Cities, although nudity very rarely occurs there today. The beach is hidden down a block-long path through the forest which leads to the shore of Cedar Lake."}}
