{"Somerville": {"Memorial Drive Apartments Historic District": "The Memorial Drive Apartments Historic District is a historic district encompassing four apartment houses on Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are located between the Anderson Memorial Bridge and the Eliot Bridge with street numbers ranging from 983 to 993 Memorial Drive. All four buildings were built between 1916 and 1924, not long after Memorial Drive had been laid out, and were, despite significant similarities of style, designed by three different architects."}}
