{"Revere": {"Delta Air Lines Flight 723": "Delta Air Lines Flight 723 was a Douglas DC-9 twin-engine jetliner, operating as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, with an intermediate stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. On July 31, 1973 at 11:08AM, while on an ILS instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glidepath, struck a seawall with a landing gear and crashed, killing all but two of its 89 occupants. Both survivors later died of their injuries."}}
