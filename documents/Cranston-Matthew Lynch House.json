{"Cranston": {"Matthew Lynch House": "The Matthew Lynch House is an historic house at 120 Robinson Street in Providence, Rhode Island. The house is a modest 1-1/2 story gambrel-roofed wood frame structure, resting on a brick foundation. It was probably built in the late 18th century as a farmhouse on the west bank of the Providence River in what was then agricultural area (and is now downtown Providence), around where Grace Church now stands, on Matthewson Street."}}
