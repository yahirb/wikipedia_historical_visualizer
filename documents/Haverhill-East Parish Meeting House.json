{"Haverhill": {"East Parish Meeting House": "The East Parish Meeting House, also known as the Fourth Parish Meeting House, is a historic church and meeting house at 150 Middle Road on the rural east side of Haverhill, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame Greek Revival building was built in 1838, replacing a previous meeting house that was built on the site in 1744. The Meeting House was used for regular services until 1906, when its congregation merged with the nearby Riverside Memorial Church."}}
