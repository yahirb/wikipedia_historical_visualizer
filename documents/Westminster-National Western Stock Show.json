{"Westminster": {"National Western Stock Show": "The historical National Western Stock Show has been held annually every January at the National Western Complex in Denver, Colorado since 1906. In 1905, several forward-thinking agriculturalists realized the need to hold an annual stock show to demonstrate better breeding and feeding techniques to area stockmen. This group included Elias M. Ammons, president of the Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association and later governor of Colorado; George Ballentine, general manager of the Denver Union Stock Yard Company; and Fred P. Johnson, publisher of the Record Stockman."}}
