{"Chicopee": {"Wistariahurst": "Wistariahurst is a historic former estate located at 238 Cabot Street in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was built in 1848 for William Skinner, the owner of a successful silk spinning and textile business. The oldest part of the mansion was built while Skinner lived in the nearby town of Williamsburg, and was moved to Holyoke in 1874 when he relocated his business there after a devastating flood."}}
