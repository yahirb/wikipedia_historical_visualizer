{"Springfield": {"Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)": "Springfield Union Station is a train and bus station in the Metro Center area of Springfield, Massachusetts. Constructed in 1926, Springfield Union Station is the fifth busiest Amtrak station in the Commonwealth.\nA large-scale $94 million renovation project restored the former station building, and it reopened in late June 2017 as a regional intermodal transit hub not only featuring Amtrak service, but serving as the new hub for the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) bus system in the area, along with the planned hub for Peter Pan Bus Lines, Greyhound service and the planned new Hartford Line."}}
