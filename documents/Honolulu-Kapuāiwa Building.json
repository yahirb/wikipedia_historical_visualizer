{"Honolulu": {"Kapu\u0101iwa Building": "The Kapu\u0101iwa Building at 426 Queen Street in the Capital Historic District of Honolulu, Hawaii, was built in 1884, during the reign of Kal\u0101kaua, originally to provide fireproof safekeeping for government documents. It was named for Lot Kapu\u0101iwa, who had reigned as Kamehameha V, and its architect, George Lucas, employed an Italianate Renaissance revival style that matched that of the other Hawaiian Monarchy buildings of that period. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 2 July 1973."}}
