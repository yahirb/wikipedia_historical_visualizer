{"Portland": {"WYNZ": "WYNZ (100.9 FM, \"Rewind 100.9\"), is a classic hits FM radio station licensed to South Portland, Maine, and broadcasting at 100.9 MHz. Until 2007, the station was an oldies formatted radio station known as \"Oldies 100.9\".\n\n\n== History ==\n100.9 FM began broadcasting in 1976 as adult contemporary station WRQN. In 1978, it was sold to the owners of 1310 AM WLOB, whose management changed the FM station to album-oriented rock as WLOB-FM. During those years, it was known as \"FM 101 - Portland's Best Rock\", giving progressive rock station 107.5 WBLM some serious competition and sometimes beating WBLM in the ratings as well."}}
