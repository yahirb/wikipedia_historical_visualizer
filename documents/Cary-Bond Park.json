{"Cary": {"Bond Park": "Fred G. Bond Metropolitan park is the largest municipal park in Cary, North Carolina. It is also one of the largest municipal parks in Wake County. It has 310 acres (1.3 km2) of recreational space, 4.2 miles (6.8 km) of trails, and a variety of athletic fields, all in a natural setting. Bond Park is home to Bond Lake, a man-made freshwater lake open to fishing and boating. The 1.5-mile Bond Lake trail circles Bond Lake, and is popular with local mountain bikers and joggers. Bond Park also is home to Bond Park Community Center, which hosts several of Cary's athletic teams, and the Cary Senior Center. The park is named after Fred G. Bond, former mayor of Cary, whose bust can be seen adjacent to Bond Park's boathouse.\nRecent renovations have improved Bond Park's trails. They are part of a town-wide trail expansion plan, which would make Bond Park a hub of several trails, with connections to the American Tobacco Trail and Umstead State Park."}}
