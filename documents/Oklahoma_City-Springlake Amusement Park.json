{"Oklahoma_City": {"Springlake Amusement Park": "Springlake Amusement Park was an amusement park in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was originally established in 1922 (some sources say 1924) by Roy Staton about six years after his spring-fed pond at NE 40th and Eastern (now Martin Luther King Blvd) had been open to swimmers and picnickers. Staton expanded the park with the addition of many rides acquired from the defunct Bell Isle Park and construction of a ballroom."}}
