{"Cleveland": {"NuCLEus": "nuCLEus is a proposed 54-story, 650-foot (200 m) mixed-used development complex planned for the Gateway District of downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The project won unanimous approval from the Cleveland Planning Commission in November 2014. Robert L. Stark of Cleveland-based Stark Enterprises is the lead developer on the project.\nThe project 54-story tower would be the 4th tallest building in the city behind Key Tower at 947 feet (289 m), Terminal Tower at 709 feet (216 m), and 200 Public Square at 659 feet (201 m). The current fourth tallest building in Cleveland is the 1964-erected Tower at Erieview which stands 529 feet.\nAs of early 2018, the project is still on hold, as the developers have been unable to secure public funding. A vote on a deal to allocate some property taxes from the Cleveland Metropolitan School District to fund the project was suspended indefinitely."}}
