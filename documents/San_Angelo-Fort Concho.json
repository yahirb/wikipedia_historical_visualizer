{"San_Angelo": {"Fort Concho": "Fort Concho is a National Historic Landmark owned and operated since 1935 by the city of San Angelo, the seat of Tom Green County in West Texas. Situated on the North Concho River, near its confluence with the South and Middle Concho Rivers, the site selected for Fort Concho was strategic to the stabilization of the region, because of the location of no fewer than five major trails in the vicinity. Though the fort was surrounded by miles of flat, treeless prairie, it was considered to be \u201cone of the most beautiful and best ordered posts in Texas.\"\nOther forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Richardson, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma."}}
