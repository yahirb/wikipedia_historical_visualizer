{"Cleveland": {"Marriott at Key Center": "The Marriott at Key Center is a skyscraper hotel in Cleveland, Ohio. The building rises 320 feet (98 m). It contains 28 floors, and was completed in 1991. The Marriott at Key Center currently stands as the 17th-tallest building in the city. The architect who designed the building was C\u00e9sar Pelli, who also designed the neighboring Key Tower, the tallest building in the city and the state. The Marriott at Key Center closely resembles the fa\u00e7ade of the Key Tower. These two buildings, together with the Society for Savings Building, comprise Key Center.\nThe Marriott at Key Center stands on the site formerly occupied by the Engineers Building, which was completed in 1910. This 14-story building had housed the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, or BLE, labor union, but was demolished in 1989 to allow for the construction of Key Center.\nIn 2016, The Marriott Hotel lost its tallest hotel in Cleveland status to the brand new Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel in late 2015, when the HCDH rose 374 feet and contains 32 floors thereby eclipsing the Marriott by 4 floors. The Hilton will almost be bookending the Marriott."}}
