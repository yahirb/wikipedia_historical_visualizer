{"Westland": {"The Canton Historical Society and Museum": "The Canton Historical Society and Museum located in Canton, Michigan was originally a one-room schoolhouse, which was built in 1884. It showed clearly that the museum was built using Georgian Revival architecture. The one-room schoolhouse was built for grades K-12, which was one of many schoolhouses in the city of Canton, MI. This particular one-room schoolhouse was the last operating schoolhouse in Wayne County, MI, and the schoolhouse was the most popular of the schoolhouses in the area."}}
