{"Lawrence": {"Blakeley Building": "The Blakeley Building is a historic commercial building at 475-479 Essex St in central Lawrence, Massachusetts. It is the only well-preserved 19th century remnant of a streetscape that extended for the entire block. The four story Classical Revival building was built in 1898 for Richard Barlow, at that time completing the block between Franklin and Hampshire Streets."}}
