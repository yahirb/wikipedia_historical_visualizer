{"Jersey_City": {"The Battery (Manhattan)": "The Battery (formerly known as Battery Park) is a 25-acre (10 ha) public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City facing New York Harbor. The park and surrounding area is named for the artillery batteries that were positioned there in the city's early years to protect the settlement behind them.\nThe Battery Conservancy, founded in 1994 by current President Warrie Price, has undertaken and funded the restoration and improvement of the once shopworn park."}}
