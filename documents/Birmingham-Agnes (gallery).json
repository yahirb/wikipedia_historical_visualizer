{"Birmingham": {"Agnes (gallery)": "Agnes was a Birmingham, Alabama photography gallery from 1993 to 2001. Shawn Boley, Jon Coffelt and Jan Hughes opened the gallery with the mission of attempting to raise awareness of social issues \u2014 such as cancer, AIDS, death and dying, the environment, homelessness, ethics, racism, classism, imprisonment \u2014 through photojournalism, film, video, poetry, and book arts. Controversial, Agnes was picketed on several occasions, one of which resulted in a USA Today article on December 5, 1994."}}
