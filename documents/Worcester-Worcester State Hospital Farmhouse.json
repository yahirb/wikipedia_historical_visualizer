{"Worcester": {"Worcester State Hospital Farmhouse": "The Worcester State Hospital Farmhouse is a historic psychiatric hospital building at 361 Plantation Street, on the former grounds of the Worcester State Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1895, it is a well-preserved local example of Georgian Revival architecture, and is notable as a prototype for similar buildings in the Massachusetts state hospital network. It served as an outbuilding of Worcester State Hospital until 1969, housing select residents who worked in its fields."}}
