{"New_York": {"Division Street (Manhattan)": "The New York City borough of Manhattan contains 214 numbered east\u2013west streets numbered from 1st to 228th, the majority of them created by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. These streets do not run exactly east\u2013west, because the grid plan is aligned with the Hudson River, rather than with the cardinal direction. Thus, the grid's \"west\" is approximately 29 degrees north of true west."}}
