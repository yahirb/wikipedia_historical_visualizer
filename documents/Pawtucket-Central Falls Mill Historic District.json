{"Pawtucket": {"Central Falls Mill Historic District": "The Central Falls Mill Historic District is located between Roosevelt Avenue and the Blackstone River in Central Falls, Rhode Island. It encompasses a collection of six mill buildings, as well as a stone dam which impounds the river, representing the finest mill constructions in the city during the 19th century. The layout of the buildings, whose short ends face the river and Roosevelt Avenue, was defined by a series of trenches (now filled in) which channeled water from the river to power the machinery of the mills."}}
