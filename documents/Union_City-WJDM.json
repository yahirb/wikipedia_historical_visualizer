{"Union_City": {"WJDM": "WJDM (AM 1530 kHz) is a radio station licensed to Elizabeth, New Jersey (the seat of Union County) and the surrounding municipalities and broadcasts a Spanish Christian format. The station's transmitter is located in nearby Union Township, Union County, New Jersey. The original calls of WELA were changed in January 1971 to avoid any confusion with now defunct WERA Plainfield, New Jersey (1590 kHz) which left the air in 1997 after being acquired by WWRL 1600 kHz New York, New York and shut down to extend that station's coverage area to the west."}}
