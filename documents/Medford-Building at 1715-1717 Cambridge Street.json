{"Medford": {"Building at 1715-1717 Cambridge Street": "The Building at 1715-1717 Cambridge Street is an historic multifamily house at 1715-1717 Cambridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built in 1845, it is one of two identical surviving rental properties built by a local developer (out of four originally built). The survival of their original building contracts provides an important window into the understanding of 19th century building practices."}}
