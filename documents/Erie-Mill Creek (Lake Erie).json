{"Erie": {"Mill Creek (Lake Erie)": "The Mill Creek is a 19-mile (31 km) long tributary of Lake Erie in Erie County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It flows from Millcreek Township through the city of Erie, into Presque Isle Bay.\nMuch of the creek in the city was channeled into the Mill Creek Tube, which was constructed after the Mill Creek's disastrous flood struck the city in 1915."}}
