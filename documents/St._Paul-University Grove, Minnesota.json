{"St._Paul": {"University Grove, Minnesota": "University Grove is a neighborhood of Falcon Heights, Minnesota, known for its 103 homes individually designed by architects. Owners have been required to use an architect since the neighborhoods creation by the University of Minnesota in 1928 to recruit and retain faculty; there is also a cap on costs, ensuring that homes would be of similar size. To balance the individuality of professors/administrators while keeping the properties in the intended group of buyers, each faculty/staff person owns the homes while the University owns the land upon which the home is situated and the faculty/staff person pays rent annually for that land use."}}
