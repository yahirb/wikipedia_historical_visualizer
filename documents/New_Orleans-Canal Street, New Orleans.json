{"New_Orleans": {"Canal Street, New Orleans": "Canal Street is a major thoroughfare in the city of New Orleans. Forming the upriver boundary of the city's oldest neighborhood, the French Quarter or Vieux Carr\u00e9, it served historically as the dividing line between the colonial-era (18th-century) city and the newer American Sector, today's Central Business District.\n\nUp until the early 1800s, it was the Creoles who lived in the Vieux Carr\u00e9."}}
