{"Evanston": {"Krause Music Store": "The Krause Music Store, a National Historic landmark building, is an award-winning adaptive re-use of a 1922-vintage structure and the final work of famed architect Louis Sullivan, considered one of the greatest architects of the Chicago School of Architecture. The Krause Music Store is the last of the 126 buildings designed by Louis Sullivan. In coining the phrase \u201cform follows function\u201d, Sullivan believed that the function of a building gave rise to its form and that the two should work in concert with each other to be beautiful."}}
