{"Dearborn": {"Ford World Headquarters": "The Ford World Headquarters, also known as the Henry Ford II World Center and popularly known as the Glass House, is the administrative headquarters for Ford Motor Company, a 12-story, glass-faced office building designed to accommodate a staff of approximately 3,000. The Glass House is located at 1 American Road at Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, Michigan, near Ford's historic Rouge plant, Greenfield Village, the Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn's Henry Ford Centennial Library, and Fair Lane, Henry Ford's personal estate.\nIn 2008, columnist George Will said the building opened at \"the peak of American confidence\" and described the headquarters as having a \"sleek glass-and-steel minimalism that characterized up-to-date architecture in the 1950s, when America was at the wheel of the world and even buildings seemed streamlined for speed\"."}}
