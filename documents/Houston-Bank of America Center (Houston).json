{"Houston": {"Bank of America Center (Houston)": "The Bank of America Center is a highrise representing one of the first significant examples of postmodern architecture construction in downtown Houston, Texas. Formerly known as the RepublicBank Center, the NCNB Center, and the NationsBank Center, the building was completed in October 1983 and designed by award winning architect Philip Johnson and partner John Burgee, and is reminiscent of the Dutch Gothic architecture of canal houses in The Netherlands. It has three segmented tower setbacks, each with \"a steeply pitched gabled roofline that is topped off with spires\". The tower was developed by Hines Interests and is owned by a joint venture of M-M Properties and an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust.\nThe banking center is housed in a separate building, due to construction problems, and has a three storey lobby. There are 32 passenger elevators each finished with wood panels that include Birdseye Maple, Macassar Ebony, Italian Willow, Tamo, and Kevazingo. The building contains an art gallery in the lobby and plans to host curated exhibitions."}}
