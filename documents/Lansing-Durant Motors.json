{"Lansing": {"Durant Motors": "Durant Motors Inc. was established in 1921 by former General Motors CEO William \"Billy\" Durant following his termination by the GM board of directors and the New York bankers that financed GM.\n\n\n== Corporate relationships ==\nDurant Motors attempted to be a full-line automobile producer of cars and fielded the Flint, Durant, and Star brands which were designed to meet Buick, Oldsmobile, Oakland, and Chevrolet price points. Billy Durant also acquired luxury-car maker Locomobile of Bridgeport, Connecticut, at its liquidation sale in 1922; in theory, Locomobile gave him a product that would compete against Cadillac, Rolls Royce and Pierce-Arrow."}}
