{"Richmond": {"Byrd Park Court Historic District": "The Byrd Park Court Historic District encompasses a small, well-preserved residential subdivision in western Richmond, Virginia. Located just east of William Byrd Park, nearly opposite the Swan Lake Drive entrance, stands Byrd Park Court, a loop road on which are set six duplexes and six single-family houses. A stone gate flanks the entrance, and the center of the loop has a grassy area with a water fountain."}}
