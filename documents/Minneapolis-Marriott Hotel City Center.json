{"Minneapolis": {"Marriott Hotel City Center": "The Marriott Hotel City Center is a 379-ft (116 m) tall skyscraper in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Completed in 1983 as the Amfac Hotel Minneapolis, it has 32 floors. The building's triangular shape, with the westernmost corner a knife's edge, enhances the illusion that this building is two-dimensional when driving north along Hennepin Avenue."}}
