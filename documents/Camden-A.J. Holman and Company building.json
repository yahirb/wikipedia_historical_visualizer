{"Camden": {"A.J. Holman and Company building": "The A.J. Holman and Company at 1222-26 Arch Street between N. 12th and N. 13th Street in the Center City area of Philadelphia was built in 1881 and was designed by the Wilson Brothers, who also designed the nearby Reading Terminal. Andrew J. Holman founded the Bible-publishing concern in 1872 and had this building constructed when their original space became too small for the growing concern.\nThe front facade of the five-story, red brick building features cast iron piers on the first floor and a triangular pediment with Gothic arch at the roofline."}}
