{"Council_Bluffs": {"Harry Buford House": "The Harry Buford House is a historic house located at 1804 North 30th Street in North Omaha, Nebraska. Built in 1929 in a Period Revival style, it was designated a landmark by the City of Omaha in 1983.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe Buford house is an anomaly, as it is a rare example of Period Revival style located in an inner city neighborhood such as the Near North Side of Omaha, rather than with the majority of houses of that style, which were being constructed in the then-new suburban neighborhoods of Country Club, Minne Lusa and Morton Meadows."}}
