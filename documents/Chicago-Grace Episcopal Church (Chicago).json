{"Chicago": {"Grace Episcopal Church (Chicago)": "Grace Episcopal Church founded in 1851 is one of the oldest Episcopal congregations in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Since December 1985 it has been located in a former printing works located at 637 South Dearborn Street in the Printer's Row neighborhood. Now also called Grace Place, the historic 3-story redbrick late 19th century Arts and Crafts building is a contributing property in the South Dearborn Street-Printing House Row North Historic District. Grace Place is also listed in the City of Chicago's Chicago Landmarks Historic Resources Survey.   \nUnder the supervision of architects Laurence Booth/Paul Hansen and Associates (Booth Hansen), the building's first floor was converted into space for church social functions as well as a center for community meetings while all of the second floor and most of the third floor were combined into worship space for the church. Booth Hansen carefully avoided the temptation to convert the building's interior into the then popular loft spaces and skillfully designed the two-story high worship space so as to minimize the intrusion of the massive wooden support posts into the raised circular sanctuary area. The remainder of the third floor was designed for offices. In 1989 Booth Hansen received the Chicago AIA chapter's 10 year award in interior architecture for Grace Place.\nGrace Episcopal Church is an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago. Its current rector is the Rev. Amity Carrubba."}}
