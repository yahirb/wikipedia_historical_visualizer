{"Huntsville": {"W. T. Hutchens Building": "The W. T. Hutchens Building is a historic commercial building in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. A three-bay building on the corner of Jefferson Street and Clinton Avenue, the two corner bays were built in 1916 and the third built in a nearly identical style in 1921. It was built in the Early Commercial brick style, which departed from highly ornamented, vertically-oriented Victorian styles, instead emphasizing horizontal orientation by using strong horizontal courses and shorter, wider windows."}}
