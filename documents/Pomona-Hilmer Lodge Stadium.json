{"Pomona": {"Hilmer Lodge Stadium": "Hilmer Lodge Stadium on the Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) campus in Walnut, California, is the athletic stadium for the community college. It is home field of the football program, but is world renown as the home of the Mt. SAC Relays, an annual, multi-day track and field festival that attracts elite athletes from around the world to this early season (April) event. The event claims to host 15,000 participants with crowds of spectators to match. The stadium is the site of 20 world records and hundreds of national records around the world.\nThe stadium was dedicated on October 8, 1948 by then local congressman, Richard M. Nixon. It was renamed after Hilmer Lodge, who created the relays in 1959 and was the college's first Track & Field/Cross Country Coach. Lodge, who died in 1977, was part of the inaugural Mt. SAC Relays Hall of Fame.\nThe stadium is also the finish for the famous Mt. SAC Cross Country Course, which hosts as many as 28,000 participants for the Mt. SAC Cross Country Invitational. It also plays host to the CIF Southern Section cross country prelims and finals, and the Western Regional preliminary to the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships.\nHilmer Lodge Stadium hosted the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1962, 1979 and 1980. It also played host to the United States women's Olympic Trials in 1968. The stadium will again host the United States Olympic Trials (combined men's and women's) in advance of the Tokyo Olympics from June 19 to 28, 2020. Prior to the trials, the stadium will be completely renovated with the ability to expand seating to 21,000 for special events. CLICK HERE to view future stadium fly-through."}}
