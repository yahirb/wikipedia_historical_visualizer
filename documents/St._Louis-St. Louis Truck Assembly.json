{"St._Louis": {"St. Louis Truck Assembly": "St. Louis Truck Assembly was a General Motors automobile factory that built GMC/Chevrolet trucks, GM \"A\" body passenger cars, the Chevrolet Nova, and 1954-1981 Corvette models. Opened in the 1920s, it closed on August 7, 1986, although the plant essentially was doomed when on August 1, 1981 one assembly line was closed and Corvette production was shifted to Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky  Thereafter, it only built R- and V-series crew cab and cab/chassis trucks before that output was moved to GM's Janesville Assembly."}}
