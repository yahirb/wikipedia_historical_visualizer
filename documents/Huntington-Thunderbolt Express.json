{"Huntington": {"Thunderbolt Express": "A thunderbolt or lightning bolt is a symbolic representation of lightning when accompanied by a loud thunderclap. In ancient Hellenic and Roman religious traditions, the thunderbolt represents Zeus or Jupiter (etymologically 'Sky Father'), thence the origin and ordaining pattern of the universe, as expressed in Heraclitus' fragment describing \"the Thunderbolt that steers the course of all things\". It is the same in other Indo-European traditions, for example the Vedic Vajra."}}
