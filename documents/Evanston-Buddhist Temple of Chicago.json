{"Evanston": {"Buddhist Temple of Chicago": "The Buddhist Temple of Chicago (BTC) was founded in October 1944 by Gyomay Kubose, a minister of the Higashi Honganji branch of the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b (\u201cTrue Pure Land School\u201d) sect, along with several laypeople who had been released from the Japanese American internment camps. Although the temple is administratively independent, the teaching lineage reflects the progressive J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b thought of Manshi Kiyozawa and his student, Haya Akegarasu, who was Kubose\u2019s teacher.\nThe temple was originally called the Chicago Buddhist Church and was located in the Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s south side."}}
