{"Buffalo": {"2016 Bethlehem Steel fire": "On November 9, 2016, at around 07:30 EST (12:30 UTC), a major fire broke out at a 1,000,000 square foot galvanizing warehouse that was formerly part of the now-vacated Bethlehem Steel complex in Lackawanna, New York, just south of Buffalo. The fire was said to have been caused by a hot bulb which fell and struck cardboard inside of the building, igniting the structure, although this has been unconfirmed. Subsequently, a thick ash cloud extended 30 miles south of the accident site, viewable from Canada, Eden, New York, and weather radars."}}
