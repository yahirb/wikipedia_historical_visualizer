{"New_York": {"Hopkins Store": "The Hopkins Store at 75 Murray Street between West Broadway and Greenwich Street in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1857-58 and features a cast-iron facade in the Venetian Renaissance style from the foundry of James Bogardus, one of the earliest of the few remaining facades created by the self-described inventor of cast-iron architecture.\nThe original tenants were Francis and John Hopkins, who had a glassware business. Beginning c.1920 the building was the location of Knickerbocker Annunciator, a supplier of elevator traveling cable, electronic cable, and annunciators.\nThe building was converted to residential use in 1994-95, at which time it was restored."}}
