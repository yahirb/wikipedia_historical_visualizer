{"Manchester": {"Free State Project": "The Free State Project (FSP) is a proposed political migration founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of limited government activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.\nParticipants sign a statement of intent declaring that they intend to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants."}}
