{"Jersey_City": {"Whitlock Cordage": "Whitlock Cordage is a former industrial complex that has been renovated for residential and commercial use located along the banks of the since-filled Morris Canal in the Lafayette Section of Jersey City, New Jersey.\nThe older buildings were originally constructed in 1860 as part of the Passaic Zinc Works, with the later buildings constructed by Whitlock Cordage in and after 1905, on a seven-acre site. Whitlock manufactured what many considered to be the world's strongest rope."}}
