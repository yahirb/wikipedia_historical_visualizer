{"Cambridge": {"Howe House (Cambridge, Massachusetts)": "The Howe House is an historic house at 6 Appleton Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in 1887 for the family of Lois Lilley Howe to a design by Cabot & Chandler. The house is principally significant for its association with Howe, one of the first female graduates of the architectural program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the first woman made fellow of the American Institute of Architects."}}
