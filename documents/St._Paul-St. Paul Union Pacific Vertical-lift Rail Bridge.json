{"St._Paul": {"St. Paul Union Pacific Vertical-lift Rail Bridge": "A vertical-lift bridge or just lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the deck.\nThe vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge. Generally speaking they cost less to build for longer moveable spans."}}
