{"Stamford": {"J. M. Wright Technical High School": "J.M. Wright Technical High School, or Wright Tech, is a technical high school located in Stamford, Connecticut, United States. It is part of the Connecticut Technical High School System.\nHaving suspended operations in 2009 due to budgetary restrictions, Wright Tech reopened its doors in 2014 to 144 first-year students after undergoing an $85 million renovation. During the groundbreaking ceremony, Connecticut Technical High School System Superintendent, Dr. Nivea L. Torres, referred to Wright Tech as the \"flagship for the district.\" By 2017, the school expects to be at capacity with nearly 600 students.\nPrior to closing, the school offered training in seven trades. For the class of 2007, the most popular were automotive, electrical, and hairdressing. In 2014, Wright Tech offered nine rigorous trade programs to students, including the system's first facilities management program, which has since become the most advanced program of its kind in the nation.\nStudents come from Stamford, Norwalk, Easton, Fairfield, Weston, Wilton, Westport, New Canaan, Greenwich, and Bridgeport. In recent years, more students have been coming from the immediate Stamford area. In the class of 2008, 38 percent of students were from local school districts and 62 percent from Bridgeport. However, in the class of 2011, 82 percent of students were from Stamford.\nTrailblazers Academy, a charter school with 150 students in grades 6 through 8 and run by the nonprofit Domus Foundation of Stamford, was housed in the Wright Tech building starting 2000, though it has since moved to downtown Stamford. Many Trailblazers students are those who have struggled in traditional schools. As of the 2006-2007 school year, about 98 percent of the students were from Stamford."}}
