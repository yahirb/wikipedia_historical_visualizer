{"Denton": {"UNT Coliseum": "The UNT Coliseum is a 9,797-seat multi-purpose arena located in Denton, Texas, United States built in 1973. Despite being home to the North Texas Mean Green men's and women's basketball teams, the athletic department rents the building from the University of North Texas. For non-athletic functions, the arena is known as the Coliseum and for athletic functions the arena is known as the Super Pit, a nickname derived from its proximity to the former home of the Mean Green basketball teams, the Ken Bahnsen Gym, nicknamed the Snake Pit."}}
