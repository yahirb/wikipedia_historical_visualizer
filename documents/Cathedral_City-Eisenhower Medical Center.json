{"Cathedral_City": {"Eisenhower Medical Center": "The Eisenhower Medical Center (EMC) is a not-for-profit hospital based in Rancho Mirage, California serving the Coachella Valley region of southeastern California. It was named one of the top one hundred hospitals in the United States in 2005.\nNamed for U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the hospital credits its initial creation to two events in 1966 when entertainer Bob Hope was asked to lend his name to a charity golf tournament and to serve on the board of the hospital that would be built from the tournament's proceeds."}}
