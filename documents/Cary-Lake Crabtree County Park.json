{"Cary": {"Lake Crabtree County Park": "Lake Crabtree County Park is a park in Wake County, North Carolina. It is a forested area between Cary, Morrisville, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport, bounded by the northeastern shore of Lake Crabtree, I-40, and Aviation Parkway. The main entrance is on the Aviation Parkway side and is equipped with two playgrounds (for different age groups), a boat dock (as well as rentable sailboats), bathrooms, an observation tower, and other amenities. A system of hiking and biking trails crosses through the park, with the most used one (especially by hikers) along the lakeshore. This trail connects the park entrance to the Black Creek Greenway-Old Reedy Creek Road intersection, near the entrance to William B. Umstead State Park.\n\n"}}
