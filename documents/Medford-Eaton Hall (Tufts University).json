{"Medford": {"Eaton Hall (Tufts University)": "Eaton Hall, built in 1908 as Eaton Memorial Library, used to be the main library building at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. The historic building was designed by Whitfield & King and donated to the university by Andrew Carnegie. It was one of the first college libraries built with Carnegie funds and is one of the few that never bore his name."}}
