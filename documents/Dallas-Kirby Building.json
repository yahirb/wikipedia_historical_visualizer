{"Dallas": {"Kirby Building": "The Kirby Building, historically known as the Busch Building, is a 17-story skyscraper in the Main Street District of Downtown Dallas. The structure was completed in 1913 by beer magnate Adolphus Busch to accompany his nearby Hotel Adolphus. The building became vacant with many older buildings during the economic downturn of the 1980s. While the building was symbolic of downtown's crash in the 1980s, it also served as a symbol of the start of the resurrection as it became the first high-rise to be converted from office use to residential apartments. The structure is a Dallas Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places."}}
