{"Beaumont": {"Hebert High School": "Hebert High School was a traditionally black high school in the South Park Independent School District in Beaumont, Texas, US. It was founded in the early 20th century to serve the black community, and became an accredited high school in 1923. In response to a court desegregation order, it was merged with Forest Park High School in 1982 to form West Brook High School, with the Hebert campus originally housing the ninth and tenth grades. The campus has since become Ozen Senior High School."}}
