{"Revere": {"James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1732)": "Colonel James Abercrombie (1732 \u2013 23 June 1775) was a British army officer who died during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThere is much uncertainty about Abercrombie's family. He may have been related to General James Abercrombie, but the Dictionary of Canadian Biography states that the common identification of him as the general's son or nephew is probably erroneous."}}
