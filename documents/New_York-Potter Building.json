{"New_York": {"Potter Building": "The Potter Building, at 38 Park Row on the corner of Beekman Street, a full-block building also known as 145 Nassau Street, in the Civic Center neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1882\u201386 and was designed by Norris G. Starkweather in a combination of the Queen Anne and neo-Grec styles, as an iron-framed office building.\nThe building employed the most advanced fireproofing methods then available, including the use of rolled iron beams, cast iron columns, brick exterior walls \u2013 its walls are 40 inches (100 cm) thick at ground level \u2013 tile arches and terra-cotta. Its terra-cotta detailing provoked the developer, Orlando B. Potter, to start his own terra cotta company on Long Island.\nThe Potter Building was converted into apartments in 1979\u201381, and was designated a New York City landmark in 1996."}}
