{"Rogers": {"Macon-Harrison House": "The Macon-Harrison House is a historic house at 209 NE Second Street in Bentonville, Arkansas. Built in 1910, it is a large two-story brick structure with limestone trim, including corner quoining, porch columns and balustrades. This high-quality late Victorian house was built by John Macon, who profited from the local apple industry by building an applejack distillery."}}
