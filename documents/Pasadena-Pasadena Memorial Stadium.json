{"Pasadena": {"Pasadena Memorial Stadium": "Veterans Memorial Stadium, opened in 1965, is a 12,700-capacity stadium in Pasadena, Texas, owned by the Pasadena ISD.\nOriginally named Pasadena Memorial Stadium, the district's Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the stadium in 2006 to honor those armed forces personnel who have sacrificed for their country. In 2004, the football field at the stadium was dedicated in honor of retired coach and athletic director Bill Newcomb, who served Pasadena ISD for more than 40 years and was head football coach at South Houston High School from 1981 to 1987. He was also a standout player at Pasadena High School in 1953-56."}}
