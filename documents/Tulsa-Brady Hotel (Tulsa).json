{"Tulsa": {"Brady Hotel (Tulsa)": "The original Brady Hotel, a three-story wood frame building, was built in 1903 at Archer and North Main in Tulsa, Oklahoma by W. Tate Brady. It was the first hotel in Tulsa with baths, conveniently located to the Frisco railroad depot, and very popular among the oil men attracted by the new oil discoveries at Glen Pool. This was also the meeting place where Charles N. Haskell announced his candidacy to become the first governor of the new state of Oklahoma. It also served as a meeting place for Democrats, who laid the groundwork to control the Constitutional Convention and maintain segregation. \nThe main competition for the Brady Hotel before statehood was the Robinson Hotel, located a short distance south on Main Street. According to a later article in the Tulsa World, the two were rivals, calling themselves, \"The best hotel in Indian Territory.\" When the Robinson added a fourth floor, the Brady added a third floor plus an elevator. When the Robinson added a fifth floor, the Brady added not only a fourth floor, and an eight-story annex."}}
