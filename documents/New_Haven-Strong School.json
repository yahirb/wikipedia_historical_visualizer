{"New_Haven": {"Strong School": "\n== Structures ==\n\n\n=== First building (1808\u2013?) ===\nNathaniel Graniss, an early area settler, felt there was need for a school in the area, and deeded land where a school was built in 1808. The building was renovated into a church in 1830, and school rooms were relegated to the basement. The church moved down the street to occupy a different building in 1864, and the building was once again utilized entirely as a school."}}
