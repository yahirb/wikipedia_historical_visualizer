{"Billings": {"Centennial Ice Arena": "Centennial Ice Arena is a 550-seat ice arena in Billings, Montana, USA. Since 2010, the arena has played host to the city's only junior league hockey club, the Billings Bulls of the NA3HL. It also hosts youth hockey and has been the home ice for the Montana Thunderblades, a USA Hockey Select youth team that won the 14U Tier II National Championship in 2014.\nPublic demand for a year-round facility to host youth and junior hockey in Billings prompted the arena's construction. Opened in 1981, Centennial Ice Arena replaced the outdoor King Avenue Ice Rink - the city's only fully maintained ice rink at the time."}}
