{"Norwalk": {"South Norwalk (Metro-North station)": "The South Norwalk Metro-North Railroad station is owned and managed by the Norwalk Transit District, and is the most significant of three stations serving the residents of Norwalk, Connecticut via the New Haven Line. Nicknamed \"SoNo\" by riders and staff, the station is the point where the Danbury Branch connects to the Northeast Corridor, as well as a peak-hour terminal for some express trains. It is the last stop for New Haven super-express trains before they run non-stop to Grand Central Terminal in New York."}}
