Though the name Albany Medical Center referring to the two institutions on their shared campus has been used for over a century, the two institutions were fiercely independent until the formation of the formal Albany Medical Center in 1982. AMC awards the Albany Medical Center Prize, the second-highest value prize in medicine and biomedical research in the United States, annually."}}
