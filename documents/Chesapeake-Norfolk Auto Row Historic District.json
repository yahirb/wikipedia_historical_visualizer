{"Chesapeake": {"Norfolk Auto Row Historic District": "The Norfolk Auto Row Historic District encompasses a commercial district just outside the downtown area of Norfolk, Virginia. The area is bounded on the south by West Brambleton Avenue, on the east by Monticello Avenue, on the north by East 13th Street, and on the west by Llewelllyn Avenue and Granby and Boush streets. The area was originally developed as a low-income housing area early in the 20th century, but was by the mid-20th century completely transformed into an area of commercial development, mainly for the sales and service of automobiles."}}
