{"West_Valley_City": {"Bacchus, Utah": "Bacchus, Utah was a small community on U-111, near the Oquirrh Mountains. It was established in 1915 when the Hercules Powder Company opened an explosives plant in the town. With improved transportation, the workers moved to more favorable locations, and the town deteriorated into a ghost town between 1930 and 1960."}}
