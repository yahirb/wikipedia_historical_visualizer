{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Lockeland Springs": "The Lockeland Springs historic neighborhood is a turn-of-the-20th-century streetcar suburb two miles northeast of downtown Nashville, Tennessee in East Nashville. In 1786, this land was granted by the State of North Carolina to Daniel Williams, in payment for service in the Revolutionary War. The first house in the area was the log cabin Williams built on the site of the present Lockeland School."}}
