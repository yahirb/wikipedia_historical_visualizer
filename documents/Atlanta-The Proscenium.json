{"Atlanta": {"The Proscenium": "A proscenium (Greek: \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) is the metaphorical vertical plane of space in a theatre, usually surrounded on the top and sides by a physical proscenium arch (whether or not truly \"arched\") and on the bottom by the stage floor itself, which serves as the frame into which the audience observes from a more or less unified angle the events taking place upon the stage during a theatrical performance. The concept of the fourth wall of the theatre stage space that faces the audience is essentially the same.\nIt can be considered as a social construct which divides the actors and their stage-world from the audience which has come to witness it."}}
