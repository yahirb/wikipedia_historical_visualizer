{"Springfield": {"Driscoll's Block": "Driscoll's Block is a historic commercial block at 211-13 Worthington Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was the first building to be built in the area after a fire destroyed five blocks of Worthington Street in 1893. The modest four story brick structure was built for J.R. Driscoll, and at first housed a bowling alley."}}
