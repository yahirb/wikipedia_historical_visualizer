{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Doctor's Building (Nashville, Tennessee)": "The Doctor's Building is a six-story commercial building in Nashville, Tennessee that was constructed in 1916 (some sources say 1910) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe building site was the former location of the home of railroad magnate Colonel E.W. Cole, with his home being the last 19th-century mansion on Church Street. A new building, known as \"The Doctor's Building\" was then constructed as a three-story building, with medical offices on the upper floors, and retail shops on the ground floor."}}
