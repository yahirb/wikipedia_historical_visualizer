{"Cincinnati": {"Courtland Flats": "The Courtland Flats are an apartment building on Court Street in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. A brick building constructed in 1902, it was the first Second Renaissance Revival apartment building to be constructed in the city's downtown. Despite the presence of many Second Renaissance Revival elements, the building includes several details more typical of the First Renaissance Revival period, such as elaborate window decorations on the exterior, multi-piece pediments above the fourth-floor windows, and prominent pilasters."}}
