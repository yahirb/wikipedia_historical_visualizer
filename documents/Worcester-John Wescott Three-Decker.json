{"Worcester": {"John Wescott Three-Decker": "The John Wescott Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 454 Pleasant Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is a well-preserved example of a Queen Anne triple-decker (built c. 1892), which is unusual in part for its orientation with the long axis parallel to the street."}}
