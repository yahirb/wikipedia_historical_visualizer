{"Redwood_City": {"Lake Lagunita": "Lake Lagunita is an artificial dry lake in Stanford University, California, located on the western side of the Stanford campus near the Lagunita residences.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDuring winters with normal rainfall, the lake used to be filled by diversion from San Francisquito Creek to a three-meter depth along with artificial water level maintenance, allowing recreational use by students. However, the lake has not been artificially filled since the late 1990s, due to problems either with the lake's damming walls or with conservation efforts."}}
