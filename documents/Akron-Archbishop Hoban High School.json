{"Akron": {"Archbishop Hoban High School": "Archbishop Hoban High School is a private, Catholic, college prep high school in Akron, Ohio, United States. It is a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. In the early 1950s, Archbishop Edward F. Hoban invited the Brothers of Holy Cross to staff a new high school to be named in his honor. The Brothers had taught him as a boy, and he knew their standard of excellence. It is the third Holy Cross high school in the Cleveland diocese, joining Gilmour Academy in Gates Mills and St. Edward High School in Lakewood."}}
