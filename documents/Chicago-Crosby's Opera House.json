{"Chicago": {"Crosby's Opera House": "Crosby's Opera House (1865\u20131871) was an opera house in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It was founded by Uranus H. Crosby in 1865 in an effort to bring a great opera hall to the city. The building was designed by William W. Boyington; the great expense of its construction ruined Crosby."}}
