{"Tulsa": {"Creek Council Oak Tree": "The Creek Council Oak Tree is a historic landmark which represents the founding of the modern city of Tulsa by the Lochapoka Clan of the Creek Nation.\nThe Creeks had been forced to leave their homeland in the southeastern United States and travel to land across the Mississippi River, where the U. S. Government had granted them land in what was then known as Indian Territory. In 1836, after their arrival, the Lochapokas chose an oak tree on top of a hill that overlooked the Arkansas River as the site of their council ground. They lit a new ceremonial fire, using coals they had carried on their journey, established a busk ground, where all council business would be conducted. These grounds were also a gathering place for tribal ceremonies, feasts and games. The site continued to be used for these events until 1896. The Creeks still hold an annual celebration of their arrival at this site on October 20."}}
