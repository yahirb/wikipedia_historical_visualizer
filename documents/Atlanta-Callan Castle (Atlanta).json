{"Atlanta": {"Callan Castle (Atlanta)": "Callan Castle at 145 (old numbering system: 61) Elizabeth Street NE (corner of Euclid St.) in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta, was originally the mansion of Asa Griggs Candler, the business tycoon who made his fortune selling Coca-Cola. It was built in 1902-1903 by George Murphy in Beaux-Arts style; the land and building cost almost $13,000. The name alludes to the family's ancestral home in Ireland (as does Callanwolde, the mansion of Candler's eldest son)\nIn 1916 Candler moved to his new mansion at 1500 Ponce de Leon Avenue in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta."}}
