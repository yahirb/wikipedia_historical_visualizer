{"Bismarck": {"Fort Lincoln Internment Camp": "Not to be confused with Fort Abraham Lincoln\nFort Lincoln Internment Camp was a military post and internment camp located south of Bismarck, North Dakota, USA, on the east side of the Missouri River.\nIt was first established as a military post in 1895 to replace Fort Yates, following the closure of the original Fort Abraham Lincoln on the west side of the Missouri River in 1891. In April 1941, it was converted into an internment camp for enemy aliens (German and Italian seamen who were captured in U.S. waters, despite the U.S. technically remaining neutral at that time)."}}
