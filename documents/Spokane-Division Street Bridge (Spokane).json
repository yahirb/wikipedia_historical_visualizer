{"Spokane": {"Division Street Bridge (Spokane)": "The Division Street Bridge in Spokane, Washington, is a 600-foot concrete span that crosses the Spokane River just north of Spokane's downtown area and a half-mile east (upstream) of Spokane Falls. Approximately 270 feet of the span is over water. The bridge was rebuilt in 1992 to increase its capacity."}}
