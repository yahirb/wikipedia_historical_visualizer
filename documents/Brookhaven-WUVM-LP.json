{"Brookhaven": {"WUVM-LP": "WUVM-LP 4 is a low-power Azteca-affiliated television station in metro Atlanta. Carrying ShopNBC until early 2006, it now carries Azteca. It is also seen locally on DirecTV, one of the few LPTV stations in the country to be seen on satellite TV (since must-carry does not apply to them), possibly because local WHSG-TV is not carried."}}
