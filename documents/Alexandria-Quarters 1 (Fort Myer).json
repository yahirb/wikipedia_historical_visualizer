{"Alexandria": {"Quarters 1 (Fort Myer)": "Fort Myer is the previous name used for a U.S. Army post next to Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, and across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Founded during the American Civil War as Fort Whipple, the post merged in 2005 with the neighboring Marine Corps installation, Henderson Hall, and is today named Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1861, the land that Fort Myer would eventually use was part of the Custis-Lee Family Plantation that Robert E. Lee and his wife Mary Custis Lee owned and lived at when not stationed elsewhere. After the Civil War began, the State of Virginia seceded, Lee resigned his commission, and they evacuated the Mansion."}}
