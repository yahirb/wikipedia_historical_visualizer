{"Medford": {"Grandfather's House": "Grandfather's House, also known as the Paul Curtis House, is a historic house at 114 South Street in Medford, Massachusetts. It is claimed to be the original house named in the American poem \"Over the River and through the Wood\" by Lydia Maria Child. (Although many people sing \"to grandmother's house we go\", the author's original words were \"to grandfather's house we go\".)\nThe house, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, is also noteworthy for being the best preserved example of Greek Revival architecture in Medford, and for its association with Paul Curtis, a prominent local shipbuilder."}}
