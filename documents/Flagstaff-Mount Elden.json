{"Flagstaff": {"Mount Elden": "Mount Elden or Elden Mountain (Hopi: Hovi'itstuyqa) is located in central Coconino County northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona. It takes its name from one of the region's earliest Anglo settlers, John Elden, who, along with his family, established a homestead on the mountain\u2019s lower slopes and grazed sheep on the open grasslands below during the late 19th century.\nThe mountain\u2019s exposed, rocky slopes are a dominant feature from almost any part of the city of Flagstaff, rising steeply nearly 2,400 feet (730 m) to an elevation of 9,301 feet (2,835 m)."}}
