{"Cambridge": {"Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology": "All MIT freshman undergraduate students (except a very small number who commute from Boston-area homes) are required to live in an MIT dormitory during their first year of study. Each MIT dormitory has its own history, traditions, and student culture. Both undergrad and grad dorms have a resident Housemaster, usually a member of the MIT faculty, living in a special apartment suite within the building."}}
