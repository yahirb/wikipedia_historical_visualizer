{"Pittsburgh": {"Hoene-Werle House": "The Hoene-Werle House in the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was built in 1887 as a double house with a courtyard in the rear and a complex molded brick and millwork cornice in the front. German immigrants Herman H. Hoene, who owned a retail piano store, and Fred C. Werle, a druggist, originally owned the house.\nThe house was abandoned then acquired by the city in the 1970s and then bought in the 1980s and restored."}}
