{"Santa_Cruz": {"San Lorenzo River": "The San Lorenzo River is a 29.3 miles (47.2 km) long river whose headwaters originate in Castle Rock State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains and flow south by southeast through the San Lorenzo Valley before passing through Santa Cruz and emptying into Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol\u00e0 expedition, gave the river its name when it passed through the area on its way north, camping near the west bank on October 17, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, \"Not far from the sea we came to a large river...It is one of the largest that we have met with on the journey...This river was named San Lorenzo.\" \"Not far from the sea\" indicates that the party probably crossed the river at one of what later became the commonly used fords."}}
