{"Cicero": {"2001 Target Grand Prix of Chicago": "The 2001 Target Grand Prix, known informally as the 2001 Grand Prix of Chicago, was a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held on July 29, 2001 at Chicago Motor Speedway in Cicero, Illinois, USA. It was the 12th round of the 2001 CART FedEx Championship Series season. Kenny Br\u00e4ck won his third race of the season and of his CART career for Team Rahal ahead of Patrick Carpentier and Gil de Ferran.\nBr\u00e4ck's quick pace allowed him to make up ground in the second half of the race and ultimately win the race itself, further distancing himself from 2nd place H\u00e9lio Castroneves in the drivers' standings."}}
