{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Rocketown": "Rocketown is a 40,000-square-foot (3,700 m2) facility with entertainment space, a coffee bar, and indoor skate park, located in Nashville, Tennessee. First opening in Franklin, TN in 1994-95 by Christian artist Michael W. Smith, Rocketown was created as a safe, drug and alcohol free place for teenagers to hang out. After closing its building for a brief period, it re-opened in 2003 in downtown Nashville."}}
