{"New_Haven": {"Berkeley Divinity School": "Berkeley Divinity School, founded in 1854, is a seminary of the Episcopal Church, based in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe seminary was founded by John Williams, then coadjutor bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut, as a mediating alternative between the Anglo-Catholic\u2013leaning General Theological Seminary in New York and the Evangelical-leaning Virginia Theological Seminary. The name of the seminary alludes to the vision of philosopher and bishop George Berkeley who a century earlier had planned a seminary in the western hemisphere; this use of his name for an educational institution precedes its association with California by some decades."}}
