{"Eagan": {"Log Chute": "Log Chute, formerly known as Paul Bunyan's Log Chute, is a log flume attraction sponsored by Xcel Energy (formerly sponsored by Brawny) at Mall of America's Nickelodeon Universe in Bloomington, Minnesota. It opened on August 11, 1992 and is one of the mall's oldest surviving acquisitions from Knott's Camp Snoopy. The ride is based on the tall tale of Paul Bunyan and is set in a mountain lumber mill featuring two lift hills and two drops as passengers experience singing animatronics, including Paul Bunyan (modeled after the Brawny mascot) and Babe the Blue Ox."}}
