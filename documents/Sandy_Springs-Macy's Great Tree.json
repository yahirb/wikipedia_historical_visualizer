{"Sandy_Springs": {"Macy's Great Tree": "The Rich's Great Tree, now the Macy's Great Tree (and briefly the Great Tree at Macy's), was a large 70\u201390-foot (21\u201327 m) tall cut pine Christmas tree that had been an Atlanta tradition since 1948. As of 2013, the tree has been replaced by a much smaller artificial one in the parking lot, which was then moved back to the roof for 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeginning in 1948, the Rich's department store put a large pine tree atop its flagship downtown Atlanta store, lighting it on Thanksgiving night."}}
