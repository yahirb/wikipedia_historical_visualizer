{"Bellevue": {"ACT Theatre": "ACT Theatre (originally A Contemporary Theatre) is a regional, non-profit theatre organization in Seattle, Washington, USA. Gregory A. Falls (1922\u20131997) founded ACT in 1965 and served as its first Artistic director; at the time ACT was founded he was also head of the Drama Department at the University of Washington. Falls was identified with the theatrical avant garde of the time, and founded ACT because he saw the Seattle Repertory Theatre as too specifically devoted to classics.\n\n\n== Facility ==\nACT is located in Kreielsheimer Place, at 700 Union Street in Downtown Seattle."}}
