{"Daly_City": {"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco": "Visitacion Valley ( VIZ-i-TAY-sh\u0259n, homophone of visitation), is a neighborhood located in the southeastern quadrant of San Francisco, California.\nVisitacion Valley is roughly defined by McLaren Park and Gleneagles Golf Course to the West, Mansell Blvd and Portola to the north, Bayview Hill and Candlestick Cove to the east, and the San Francisco / San Mateo County line to the south. The streets of this neighborhood straddle the border between San Francisco and Daly City, hence Visitacion Valley partially blends in with the adjacent Daly City neighborhood of Bayshore."}}
