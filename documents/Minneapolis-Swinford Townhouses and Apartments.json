{"Minneapolis": {"Swinford Townhouses and Apartments": "The Swinford Townhouses and Apartments are a development of townhouses and apartments in the Loring Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Both buildings are located in an area that surrounded the once-elegant Hawthorne Park. The townhomes were built first, in 1886 by Hodgson & Sons in the Second Empire style, using red brick, stone, and terra cotta."}}
