{"Hoboken": {"Greenwich Street": "Greenwich Street is a north-south street in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It extends from the intersection of Ninth Avenue and Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District at its northernmost end to its southern end at Battery Park, interrupted between Cortlandt Walk and Liberty Street by the World Trade Center site. As the World Trade Center is redeveloped, the street's sections will be reconnected."}}
