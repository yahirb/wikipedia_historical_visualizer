{"Kansas_City": {"Turner Bridge": "The K-32 Turner Bridge was a bridge that crossed the Kansas River during its almost 60 mile journey through Kansas City, and Topeka. It first opened in 1955 as a two lane steel through-truss bridge. In 2001, the bridge was torn down, due to its major superstructure problems, and with the growing area, could no longer handle the traffic flow as a two lane."}}
