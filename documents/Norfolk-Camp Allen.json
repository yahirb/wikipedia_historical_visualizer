{"Norfolk": {"Camp Allen": "Camp Allen, is a small United States Marine Corps base in Norfolk, Virginia, a satellite of the Naval Station Norfolk. In 1942 the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks wanted the first Seabee training center close to an existing Naval training facility with Norfolk being chosen because of the available land that could be purchased. On 25 March 1942 the Commandant of the 5th Naval District announced that the U.S. Naval Construction Training Center, Naval Operating Base Norfolk had been commissioned 4 days prior."}}
