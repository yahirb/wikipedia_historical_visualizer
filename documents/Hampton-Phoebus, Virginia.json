{"Hampton": {"Phoebus, Virginia": "Phoebus (formerly Chesapeake City) was an incorporated town located in Elizabeth City County on the Virginia Peninsula in eastern Virginia. Upon incorporation in 1900, it was named in honor of local businessman Harrison Phoebus (1840\u20131886), who is credited with convincing the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) to extend its tracks to the town from Newport News.\nThe town and county are both extinct, as they were consolidated by mutual consent with the independent city of Hampton in 1952, and adopted the latter's name. Phoebus is now an important historic neighborhood of Hampton and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}}
