{"Minneapolis": {"Marcy-Holmes, Minneapolis": "Marcy-Holmes is the first neighborhood of Minneapolis. It is bordered on the south by the Mississippi River, to the east by the University of Minnesota and 15th Avenue SE, to the north by the railroad tracks that separate it from the Como Neighborhood, and to the west by Central Avenue. Although somewhat confusing to newcomers, the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood is considered part of Southeast Minneapolis, despite its seemingly centralized location within the city today."}}
