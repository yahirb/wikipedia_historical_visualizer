{"Yonkers": {"Benjamin P. Westervelt House": "The Benjamin P. Westervelt House, located at 253 County Road in Cresskill, Bergen County, New Jersey, was the home of Benjamin P. Westervelt, a member of the local militia during the American Revolutionary War. The main wing of the Dutch Colonial-style house was built by Westervelt in 1808, but the Westervelt family has continuously occupied the site since at least 1778.\n\nThe house, which has been used as a background in several films, was listed on New Jersey Register of Historic Places in 1980, and the National Register of Historic Places in 1983."}}
