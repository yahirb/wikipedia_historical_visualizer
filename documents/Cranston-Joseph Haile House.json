{"Cranston": {"Joseph Haile House": "The Joseph Haile House (or Gardner House) is an historic house at 106 George Street in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. It is a 3-1/2 story brick structure, appearing taller than that due to its hillside location and raised basement. It is a well-preserved example of Federal styling, which underwent a careful restoration in the 1930s by George Warren Gardner, who filled the house with early American furniture."}}
