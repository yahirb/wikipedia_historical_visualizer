{"Oakland": {"Preservation Park": "Preservation Park is located in Oakland, California. The park includes sixteen historic buildings, five of which stand in their original location, and eleven of which were moved from elsewhere in Oakland to avoid demolition. The sixteen houses are arranged to resemble a late 19th-century Oakland neighborhood."}}
