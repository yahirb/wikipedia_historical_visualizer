{"Cicero": {"Holy Cross Church (Chicago)": "Holy Cross in Chicago, referred to in Lithuanian as \u0160v. Kry\u017eiaus ba\u017eny\u010dia, is a historic church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago located on West 46th Street in Chicago, Illinois. Built by Lithuanian immigrants, it bears a striking resemblance to many of Chicago's so-called \"Polish Cathedrals\" by virtue of the common heritage Poles and Lithuanians shared during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and reflected in their architectural tastes."}}
