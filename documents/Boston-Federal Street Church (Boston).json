{"Boston": {"Federal Street Church (Boston)": "The Federal Street Church (established 1729) was a congregational unitarian church in Boston, Massachusetts. Organized in 1727, the originally presbyterian congregation changed in 1786 to \"Congregationalism\", then adopted the liberal theology of its fifth Senior Minister, William Ellery Channing, (1780-1842). For most of the 18th century the church was known as the Long Lane Meeting-House."}}
