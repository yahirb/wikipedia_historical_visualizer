{"Mountain_View": {"Bridge School Benefit": "The Bridge School Benefit was an annual charity concert held in Mountain View, California, every October at the Shoreline Amphitheatre from 1986 until 2016. The concerts lasted the entire weekend and were organized by musicians Neil Young and Pegi Young. An annual Bay Area highlight, the concerts were billed online as the primary means of funding for The Bridge School; over both days, the reserved seats alone brought in well over a million dollars every year."}}
