{"Columbia": {"Currell College": "Currell College, completed in 1919, is an historic two-story redbrick university building on the campus of the University of South Carolina (USC) in Columbia, South Carolina in the United States. It was designed by Darlington native William Augustus Edwards who designed academic buildings at 12 institutions of higher learning as well as 13 courthouses and numerous other buildings in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Currell, which is pronounced as if it were spelled Curl, is the only building that Edwards built for USC. The Cain House at 1619 Pendleton Street which he designed in 1912 for a private owner, though, is now part of the expanded USC campus and is used as The Inn at USC.\nIt was originally named Petigru College and was built to serve as the USC law school, which had outgrown its quarters in Legare College."}}
