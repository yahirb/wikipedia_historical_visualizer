{"Quincy": {"Forbes Hill Standpipe": "The Forbes Hill Standpipe is a historic water tower structure located on Reservoir Road in Quincy, Massachusetts, USA. The tower was built in 1899-1902 to contain a 330,000 US gallons (1,200,000 l; 270,000 imp gal) steel water tank. The site originally included an adjacent reservoir that supplied the Quincy with water from the Metropolitan Boston Water System. The standpipe was taken out of service in 1955 and the reservoir was filled in."}}
