{"Huntsville": {"Randolph Street Church of Christ": "The Randolph Street Church of Christ is a historic church in Huntsville, Alabama. It was built in 1887 in a Gothic Revival style similar to rural churches, but built of brick. Rather than a central entrance, the tower contains doors under pointed toplights on the sides, and a double lancet window joined under a pointed arch."}}
