{"Tuscaloosa": {"Hugh R. Thomas Bridge": "The Hugh Rowe Thomas Bridge is a six-lane, girder bridge spanning the Black Warrior River along U.S. Route 43 and Alabama State Route 69, connecting downtown Tuscaloosa and Northport in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, that opened in 1974. The bridge is split in Tuscaloosa to accommodate two major, one-way thoroughfares (Lurleen Wallace Boulevard North and South), before joining together heading towards Northport. It replaced a lift bridge that was built in 1922 and demolished in 1973."}}
