{"Troy": {"Poesten Kill": "The Poesten Kill is a 26.2-mile-long (42.2 km) creek in upstate New York located entirely in Rensselaer County, which flows westerly from its source at Dyken Pond in the town of Berlin to its mouth at the Hudson River in the city of Troy. It has been used historically as a source of water for local inhabitants and farmers and became even more important as a source of water power during the Industrial Revolution, during which many mills and factories sprung up along its banks.\nIts name is derived from the name of a local farmer that lived near the creek in the 1660s, and the Dutch word kill, meaning creek."}}
