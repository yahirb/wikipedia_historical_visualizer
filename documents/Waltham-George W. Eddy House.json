{"Waltham": {"George W. Eddy House": "The George W. Eddy House is a historic house at 85 Bigelow Road in Newton, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story stucco-clad house was built in 1913 for George W. Eddy, a merchant, to a design by the noted area firm of Chapman & Frazer. It is Newton's finest example of Craftsman styling; its slate hip roof includes curved sections above paired windows, a detail that is repeated in dormers that pierce the roof."}}
