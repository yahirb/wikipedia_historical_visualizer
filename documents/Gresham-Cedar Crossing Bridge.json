{"Gresham": {"Cedar Crossing Bridge": "Cedar Crossing Bridge is a covered bridge in southeast Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Built in 1982, it carries Deardorff Road over Johnson Creek. The Oregon Department of Transportation notes that the bridge, even though it is covered, is \"not a true covered bridge\" because it does not use a timber truss for support."}}
