{"Waco": {"Carroll Field": "Carroll Field was owned by Baylor University; the Baylor Bears football program played games there from 1906 to 1925, and from 1930 to 1935. Following the construction of the Carroll Science Building in 1902, the field was located between the building and Waco Creek; the field took over as the location of football games from an unnamed field adjacent to and northwest of Old Main. From 1926 to 1929, Baylor football games were played at the Cotton Palace in Waco."}}
