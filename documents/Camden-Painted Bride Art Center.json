It is located at 230 Vine Street between N. 2nd and N. 3rd Streets in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\nThe Painted Bride was founded as a gallery space in an old bridal shop on South Street in 1969 by Gerry Givnish, Sylvia and Larry Konigsberg, and other visual artists. Its name derives from a mannequin placed in the shop's window, which became an attraction as people came by to see what provocative outfit it was wearing, or what lewd position it was placed in."}}
