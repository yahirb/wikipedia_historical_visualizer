{"Portland": {"South Park Blocks": "The South Park Blocks form a city park in downtown Portland, Oregon. The Oregonian has called it Portland's \"extended family room\", as Pioneer Courthouse Square is known as Portland's \"living room\".\nTwelve blocks in length, it is intersected by the Portland Streetcar and forms the Portland Cultural District and the greenspace at the center of Portland State University."}}
