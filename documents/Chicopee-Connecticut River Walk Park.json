{"Chicopee": {"Connecticut River Walk Park": "The Connecticut River Walk is partially constructed park and bikeway in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, along the banks of New England's largest river, the Connecticut River. Currently, Springfield's section of this park is 3.7 miles long, running from Chicopee, Massachusetts to the South End Bridge in Springfield, Massachusetts. Unique features of the trail include its path alongside an active - and soon-to-be the United States' first high-speed - train line, making it a \"rail-with-trail,\" and its passing in very close proximity to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame."}}
