{"Richmond": {"Fairmount, Richmond, Virginia": "Originally a trolley car suburb in the years just before the dawn of the 20th century, the Fairmount neighborhood in Church Hill, Richmond, Virginia, is located just north of Union Hill. Much of the neighborhood was developed from the 1890s to the 1920s, and its buildings largely reflect Queen Anne, Italianate, and 1920s bungalow architecture. What is likely the oldest remaining residence, a frame house, probably dates from before 1870."}}
