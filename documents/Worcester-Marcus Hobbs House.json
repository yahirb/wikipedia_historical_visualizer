{"Worcester": {"Marcus Hobbs House": "The Marcus Hobbs House is an historic house at 16 William Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. This 2.5 story wood frame house was built in 1849 by Marcus Hobbs, a carpenter, and was originally in a Greek Revival style, with corner pilasters, tall first-floor windows, and a porch with fluted Doric columns. In about 1870 it was restyled with significant Italianate features, including the round-arch gable window, paired brackets in the eaves, and dentil molding."}}
