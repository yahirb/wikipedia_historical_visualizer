{"New_York": {"Tetsu (restaurant)": "Tetsu is a modern Japanese restaurant conceived by Michelin-starred chef Masa Takayama, Tetsu serves a Robatayaki-based menu with an emphasis upon grilled fare. The first location opened in the Aria Resort & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip in 2012, replacing Chef Takayama's Shaboo, which had occupied the space since 2009.  In November 2017 a second branch opened in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The New York location features a casual ground floor space for a la carte dining, and a separate cellar space named Basement which will serve fixed-price omakase meals.\nThe New York City location of Tetsu, executed by architecture firm MN Design Professional Corporation in conjunction with structural engineering firm Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger, is located in a nationally landmarked \u201ccast-iron\u201d building, renowned for its architectural significance in New York City. The design of the space features a play on the original structure\u2019s materials, using iron, blackened steel, and timber to create a modern, yet historically responsive design, as well as furniture developed by New York City based craftsman Andre Joyau.\nIn February 2018, it was announced that original Las Vegas location of Tetsu would be closing on April 2 of that year."}}
