{"Providence": {"Dexter Asylum": "Dexter Asylum was a \"poor farm\" on the East Side of Providence, Rhode Island. It was built in 1828 and housed poor, elderly, and mentally ill residents who could not otherwise take care of themselves. In 1957 it was sold via auction to Brown University and demolished for a complex of athletic fields and buildings."}}
