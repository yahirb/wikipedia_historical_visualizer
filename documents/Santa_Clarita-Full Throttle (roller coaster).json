{"Santa_Clarita": {"Full Throttle (roller coaster)": "Full Throttle is a steel launched roller coaster at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California. The ride is designed by Premier Rides and featured the world's tallest vertical loop at 160 feet (49 m) when it opened (this record is now held by Flash, a steel roller coaster at Lewa Adventure, China). It is also the first roller coaster to feature a top-hat element on a loop."}}
