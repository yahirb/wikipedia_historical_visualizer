{"Boston": {"Trans National Place": "Trans National Place, also known as 115 Winthrop Square, was a proposed supertall skyscraper in Boston, Massachusetts, US. Original designs were completed by architect Renzo Piano (with Boston firm Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc.) who later left the project in March 2007. Trans National Place was intended to stand as the tallest building in Boston, Massachusetts, and New England, surpassing the 60-story John Hancock Tower by 15 stories and at least 210 feet (64 meters) to become the tallest building in the city. The developer was local businessman Steve Belkin, who also owns an adjoining mid-rise building, which would have been torn down as part of the project."}}
