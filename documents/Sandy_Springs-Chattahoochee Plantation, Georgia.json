{"Sandy_Springs": {"Chattahoochee Plantation, Georgia": "Chattahoochee Plantation is an area of east-southeastern Cobb County, Georgia, United States which was incorporated as a city in 1961 as a legislated boundary to prevent the city of Atlanta from annexing into Cobb County. Despite this, it never organized a city government, and its city charter was revoked along with dozens of others in 1995. The \"city\" was only ten feet wide and approximately seven miles long."}}
