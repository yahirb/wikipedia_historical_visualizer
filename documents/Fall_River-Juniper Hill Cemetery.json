{"Fall_River": {"Juniper Hill Cemetery": "Juniper Hill Cemetery is a historic cemetery at 24 Sherry Avenue in Bristol, Rhode Island. The original 22 acres (89,000 m2) were purchased from Levi DeWolf, a local farmer, in 1856, and the cemetery corporation that owns it was chartered in 1864. It is a fine example of the mid-19th century rural cemetery movement, with winding lanes and paths."}}
