{"Somerville": {"Club Passim": "Club Passim is an American folk music club in the Harvard Square area of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was opened by Joyce Kalina (now Chopra) and Paula Kelley in 1958, when it was known as Club 47 (based on its then address, 47 Mount Auburn Street, also in Cambridge; it moved to its present location on Palmer Street in 1963), and changed its name to simply Passim in 1969. \"Passim\" in the name is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable and as if that were \"seem\"; it derives from passim (usually pronounced differently), commonly found in footnotes."}}
