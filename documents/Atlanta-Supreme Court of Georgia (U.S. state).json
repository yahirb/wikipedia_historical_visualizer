{"Atlanta": {"Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)": "The Supreme Court of Georgia is the highest judicial authority of the US state of Georgia. The court was established in 1845 as a three-member panel. Since 1896, the justices (increased in number to six, then to seven in 1945, and finally to nine in 2017) have been elected by the people, and today those elections are non-partisan."}}
