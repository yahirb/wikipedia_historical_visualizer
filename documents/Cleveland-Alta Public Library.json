{"Cleveland": {"Alta Public Library": "Alta Public Library is a historic library building in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Designed by noted New York City architect George B. Post, the building (completed in 1914) was an addition to the existing Alta House, a settlement house for the Italian American community in Cleveland. Although Alta House burned in 1980 and was demolished in 1981, the library survived undamaged."}}
