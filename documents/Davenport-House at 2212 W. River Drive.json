{"Davenport": {"House at 2212 W. River Drive": "The House at 2212 W. River Drive is a historic building located in the West End of Davenport, Iowa, United States. This small house is one of the few buildings from the city's earliest decades to remain in existence. The original portion of the house on the east side is constructed of local limestone, which was available in abundance in the years before industrialization made other building materials available."}}
