{"Salt_Lake_City": {"ZCMI Cast Iron Front": "The ZCMI Cast Iron Front is a historic building facade, currently attached to the City Creek Center facing South Main Street in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The facade, built out of cast iron and stamped steel between 1876 and 1901, is a well-preserved example of a metal facade, and a reminder of the city's 19th-century commercial past. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970."}}
