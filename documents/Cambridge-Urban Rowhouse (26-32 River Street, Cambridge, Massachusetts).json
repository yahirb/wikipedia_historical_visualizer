{"Cambridge": {"Urban Rowhouse (26-32 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts)": "The Urban Rowhouse is an historic residential rowhouse located at 26-32 River Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. These rowhouses were built in 1860 by Frederick Clapp, and are among the earliest surviving examples of the type in the city. They feature a combination of brick and brownstone masonry, but also with some trim made out of wood that has been treated to appear like brownstone."}}
