{"Lansing": {"Jenison Fieldhouse": "Jenison Fieldhouse (alternately referred to in university publications as Jenison Field House), is a 10,004-seat, later reduced to 6,000-seat, multi-purpose arena in East Lansing, Michigan. The arena opened in 1940 and was named for alumnus Frederick Cowles Jenison, whose estate, along with PWAP funds, funded the building. It was home to the Michigan State University Spartans basketball team before they moved to Breslin Center in the fall of 1989."}}
