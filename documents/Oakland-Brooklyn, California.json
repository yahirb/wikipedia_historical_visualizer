{"Oakland": {"Brooklyn, California": "Brooklyn is a former city in Alameda County, California, now annexed to Oakland, California.\n\nBrooklyn first formed from the amalgamation in 1856 of two settlements, the sites of which are both now within the city limits of Oakland: San Antonio and Clinton. The name Brooklyn commemorated the ship that had brought Mormon settlers to California in 1846."}}
