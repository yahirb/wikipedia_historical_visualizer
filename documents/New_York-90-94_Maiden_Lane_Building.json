{"New_York": {"90-94 Maiden Lane Building": "90-94 Maiden Lane at Gold Street, between William and Pearl Streets in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1870-71 in the French Second Empire style and is attributed to Charles Wright. It has a cast-iron fa\u00e7ade from Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Works, and is one of the few surviving examples of cast-iron architecture between Fulton Street and the Battery, as well as one of the handful of mid-19th century commercial buildings extant in Lower Manhattan. The building's fa\u00e7ade was commissioned by Roosevelt & Son, the leading plate glass and mirror importer; Theodore Roosevelt Sr., the father of the U.S. President of the same name, was one of the company's principals. Unlike most other buildings of its sort, it has not been converted into condominium apartments, and is still in use as a commercial building.\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark on August 1, 1989."}}
