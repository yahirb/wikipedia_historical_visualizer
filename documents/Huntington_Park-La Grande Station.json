{"Huntington_Park": {"La Grande Station": "La Grande Station was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's (Santa Fe) main passenger terminal in Los Angeles, California, until the opening of Union Station in 1939.\nHeavy damage from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake meant the last operating years of the station were spent in a state of disrepair as portions of the building had to be removed for the safety of passengers. When Union Station opened in 1939, Santa Fe moved all of its passenger services there and the building was demolished in 1946."}}
