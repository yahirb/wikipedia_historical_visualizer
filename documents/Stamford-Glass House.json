{"Stamford": {"Glass House": "The Glass House or Johnson house, is a historic house museum on Ponus Ridge Road in New Canaan, Connecticut. Built in 1949, it was designed by Philip Johnson as his own residence, and \"universally viewed as having been derived from\" the Farnsworth House design, according to Alice T. Friedman. Johnson curated an exhibit of Mies van der Rohe work at the Museum of Modern Art in 1947, featuring a model of the glass Farnsworth House."}}
