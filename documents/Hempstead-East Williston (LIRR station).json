{"Hempstead": {"East Williston (LIRR station)": "East Williston is the first station along the Oyster Bay Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, at Hillside Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue in East Williston, New York. Electric third rail territory ends just north of the station, so most trains are diesel bi-level trains, but one electric train a day, Train #1501, originates here, during the morning rush hour. This is the only Oyster Bay Branch station located in fare zone 4."}}
