{"Wichita_Falls": {"Geology of Wichita Falls, Texas": "\n== Exposed Rocks ==\nThe exposed strata at the surface in and around Wichita Falls are the products of one ancient period of deposition with a modest amount of recent and modern alteration. In all cases, the strata are products of terrigenous (non-marine) environments dominated by fluvial depositional and erosional systems (rivers and streams).\n\n\n=== Brief geologic history ===\nThe rocks found in and around Wichita Falls result from southwesterly-flowing Permian streams that deposited sands in channels and silts and clays on the surrounding floodplains."}}
