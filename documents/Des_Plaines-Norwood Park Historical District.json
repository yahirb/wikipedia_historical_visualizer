{"Des_Plaines": {"Norwood Park Historical District": "The Norwood Park Historical District (also known as Old Norwood) is a historic district in the Norwood Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. It is bordered by Bryn Mawr, Avondale, and Harlem Avenues, and is home to the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House, which was built in 1833 and is widely considered to be the oldest house in Chicago. (However, it was not located in Chicago at the time it was built; Norwood Park was annexed to Chicago in 1893.) The historic district is also home to Norwood Park Public School, William Howard Taft High School, Norwood Park (the park), Myrtle Park, and Norwood Circle Park."}}
