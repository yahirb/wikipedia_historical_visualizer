{"Lorain": {"Charles Berry Bridge": "The Charles Berry Bridge, in Lorain, Ohio along U.S. Route 6 (US 6), is the second-largest bascule bridge in the world. It was dedicated on Veterans Day in 1988. The bridge had been built in the late 1930s and in use for roughly 48 years before extensive rehabilitation was finished and the bridge was officially renamed in honor of Lorain native Charles J. Berry, a Marine who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during a minor grenade battle on Iwo Jima."}}
