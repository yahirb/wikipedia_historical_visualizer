{"Castle_Rock": {"Continental Divide Raceways": "Continental Divide Raceways was a race track located in Castle Rock, Colorado. Built in 1959, it featured a 2.8-mile (4.5 km) road course, half-mile (.805 km) oval, and 4,200-foot (1,300 m) drag strip. The land was intended to be used for a multi-sport spectator venue, but a racing complex was built after a hill climb was staged on the property."}}
