{"Minneapolis": {"RBC Plaza (Minneapolis)": "RBC Plaza is a 40-story office tower and retail center located along Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota that serves as the U.S. headquarters for RBC Wealth Management. The building was formerly known as Dain Rauscher Plaza for Dain Rauscher Wessels, a regional brokerage and investment banking firm based in Minneapolis. Following the 2000 acquisition of Dain Rauscher Wessels by the Royal Bank of Canada and 2008 end of use of the brand by RBC, the building was given its current name."}}
