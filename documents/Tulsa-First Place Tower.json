{"Tulsa": {"First Place Tower": "First Place Tower is a skyscraper located at 15 East Fifth in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was completed in 1973 and has 41 stories. At 516 feet (157 m) in height, it is the third tallest building in Tulsa behind BOK Tower and Cityplex Towers, and the fourth tallest in Oklahoma. Although it shares an address with the adjacent First National Bank Building, it faces Boston Avenue.\nFrom 2006 to 2017 it was owned by Maurice Kanbar, a California entrepreneur who had extensive holdings in downtown Tulsa until he sold a portfolio of his holdings, including this building, in 2017 to his operating partner, Stuart Price.\nIn June 2014, CB/Richard Ellis (CBRE), a commercial real estate firm, sued Kanbar Properties and John and Stuart Price, Kanbar's ownership properties, for breach of a contract involving the lease of office space for ONE Gas Inc. in the tower. CBRE alleged damages of one million dollars."}}
