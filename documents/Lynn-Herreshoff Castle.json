{"Lynn": {"Herreshoff Castle": "Herreshoff Castle, formerly known as Castle Brattahlid, is an unusual residence located at 2 Crocker Park, Marblehead, Massachusetts. As of 2006 it was a private residence offering bed-and-breakfast rentals.\nThe castle was built in the 1920s by Marblehead artist Waldo Ballard and his wife, who stated that they based their design on Erik the Red's castle at Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0 in Greenland, although the structure is Gothic in nature and does not resemble buildings of the type that would have been constructed at Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0 during the era of Erik the Red."}}
