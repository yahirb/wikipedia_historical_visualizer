{"Hoboken": {"Partisan Defense Committee": "The Partisan Defense Committee describes itself as \"a class-struggle, non-sectarian legal and social defense organization that champions cases and causes in the interests of the whole of the working people.\" The PDC works in accordance with the political orientation of the Spartacist League. The committee organizes demonstrations and performs legal work in defense of \"class struggle\" prisoners. Its longest standing campaign has been in defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal."}}
