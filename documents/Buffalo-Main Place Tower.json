{"Buffalo": {"Main Place Tower": "The Main Place Tower is located at 350 Main Street, in Buffalo, NY. The skyscraper is the fourth tallest building in the city, and home to a large number of technology and communication firms. The tower is connected to the Main Place Mall, downtown's only shopping mall, with a gross leasable area of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2). In recent years, it has lost a great deal of its retail shops to suburban shopping centers."}}
