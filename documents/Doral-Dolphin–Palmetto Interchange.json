{"Doral": {"Dolphin\u2013Palmetto Interchange": "The Dolphin\u2013Palmetto Interchange, also known as 826\u2013836, is a complex four-level stack interchange in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It primarily serves as a highway interchange between State Road 826 (SR 826, Palmetto Expressway) and SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway), but also has ramps to surface streets such as SR 969 (Milam Dairy Road) and Flagler Street. The reconstruction project was completed in phases from 2012 to 2015-2016, at a cost of about $560 million, with related construction beginning in 2009, replacing the old two-level diamond interchange."}}
