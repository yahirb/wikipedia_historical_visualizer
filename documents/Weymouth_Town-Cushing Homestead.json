{"Weymouth_Town": {"Cushing Homestead": "The Cushing Homestead is a historic house at 210 East Street in Hingham, Massachusetts. The home is a \u200b2 1\u20442-story rear saltbox, and has traces of both 17th-century English style as well as later 18th-century Georgian. The two rooms that originally made up the house look much today as they likely did before the house was later enlarged."}}
