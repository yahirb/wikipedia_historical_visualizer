{"Cleveland": {"Garfield Building (Cleveland)": "The Garfield Building is an 1898-built 150 foot 13 story high-rise on the corner of Euclid and East Sixth Street across the street from the future 515 Euclid Avenue skyscraper in downtown Cleveland's East 4th Street. The edifice was built by two of President James A. Garfield's sons and it was 11 stories when first erected but two more stories were added later. The Garfield is notable for being the headquarters of NatCity Investments which went bankrupt in the 2008 financial meltdown on Wall Street. The Garfield is one city block wide and stands directly west of the former National City Bank's headquarters in the Guardian Bank Building. In early 2015, it was purchased by Millennia Companies, with plans to convert it into apartments.\nHaving sat vacant for years amid debates over its future, the Garfield attracted renewed attention in April 2015 after portions of the parapet fell onto the sidewalk and adjacent parked cars. Local officials responded by proposing a law that would strengthen inspection requirements."}}
