{"Medford": {"Route 16 (MBTA station)": "Route 16 is a proposed station on the MBTA Green Line \"D\" Branch in Somerville, Massachusetts; it would be built as part of a future third phase of the Green Line Extension (GLX). Route 16 would consist of one island platform, which would serve the \"D\" Branch's two tracks. The station was dropped from the list of stations that will open in 2020, in favor of the \"D\" Branch terminating at College Avenue."}}
