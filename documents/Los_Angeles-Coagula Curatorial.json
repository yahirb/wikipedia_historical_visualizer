{"Los_Angeles": {"Coagula Curatorial": "Coagula Curatorial is a contemporary art gallery founded in April 2012 by Mat Gleason, Los Angeles art critic & curator. From 1992-2011, Gleason published Coagula Art Journal, a free zine-style publication on contemporary art, which gained notoriety for its \"no holds barred\" critique of the contemporary art world.\nFollowing the same spirit as the magazine, the gallery opened on Los Angeles' historic Chung King Road and has hosted solo shows by contemporary artists such as Karen Finley, Kim Dingle, Gronk (artist), Llyn Foulkes, Sheree Rose and others."}}
