{"Tallahassee": {"Centre of Tallahassee": "The Centre of Tallahassee, formerly Tallahassee Mall, is a local semi-enclosed shopping center and entertainment venue (formerly a fully enclosed regional shopping mall) located at the intersection of North Monroe Street and John Knox Road in Tallahassee, Florida. Since the official close of the faltering Northwood Mall in 1986 (and subsequent repurposing as a strip mall-styled office complex), The Tallahassee Mall became the older of two surviving enclosed malls in the Tallahassee area, the other being Governor's Square.\nThe Centre's present anchor stores include AMC Theatres, Belk, Burlington Coat Factory, and Ross Dress For Less within several big box stores including Barnes & Noble and Guitar Center as well as Victoria's Secret and GNC, all of which are carryovers from its previous incarnation as the Tallahassee Mall."}}
