{"Minneapolis": {"A. A. Ames": "Albert Alonzo \"Doc\" Ames (January 18, 1842 \u2013 November 16, 1911) was a doctor and politician who held four non-consecutive terms as mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota. His fourth term was marked by allegations of widespread corruption which were popularized by muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens in a 1903 article in McClure's Magazine titled The Shame of Minneapolis. Ames was found guilty of corruption, but after a successful appeal and multiple mistrials the charges were dropped."}}
