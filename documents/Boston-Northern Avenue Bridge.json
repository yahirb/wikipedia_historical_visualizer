{"Boston": {"Northern Avenue Bridge": "The Northern Avenue Bridge, also known as the Old Northern Avenue Bridge is a bridge that spans Fort Point Channel Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1908, it was closed to vehicle traffic in 1999 and operated as a pedestrian bridge until December 2014 when it was closed after inspectors found that thirteen floor beams were unsafe for pedestrians. The center span of the truss also carried a single track for the Union Freight Railroad, although it was designed for two tracks."}}
