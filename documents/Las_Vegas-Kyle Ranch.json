{"Las_Vegas": {"Kyle Ranch": "The Kyle Ranch was established by Conrad Kiel in 1875 in what is now North Las Vegas, Nevada. The ranch's name is spelled alternately as \"Kiel\" and \"Kyle\" because Conrad Kiel spelled his name and ranch both ways. The site is currently managed by the City of North Las Vegas Parks and Recreation Division as the \"Kiel Ranch Historic Park.\" As of July 2016, the park is open to the public."}}
