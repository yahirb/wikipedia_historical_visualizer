{"Buffalo": {"J. N. Adam\u2013AM&A Historic District": "J. N. Adam\u2013AM&A Historic District is a national historic district located at Buffalo in Erie County, New York. The district resulted from the agglomeration of commercial structures over many years of commercial growth and still reflects conscious decisions made by the original planners of the J. N. Adam & Co., and later AM&A's department stores. The main department store was designed by Starrett & van Vleck and built in 1935, with additions made in 1946-1948."}}
