{"Pawtucket": {"Wanskuck Historic District": "The Wanskuck Historic District is a historic district in the city of Providence, Rhode Island encompassing a mill village with more than two hundred years of history. As early as the mid-18th century, mills stood on the West River in northern Providence, a development which continued with the rise of industrialization in the 19th century. The mill village of Wanskuck is organized around three thoroughfares: Branch Street, Veazie Street, and Woodward Road, and is roughly bounded on the east by Louisquisset Pike (Rhode Island Route 146) and to the northwest by the city line with North Providence."}}
