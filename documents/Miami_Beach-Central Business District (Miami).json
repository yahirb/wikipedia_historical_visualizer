{"Miami_Beach": {"Central Business District (Miami)": "Central Business District (CBD) is the historic city center of what has become Greater Downtown Miami, in Miami, Florida, United States. It is generally bound by Biscayne Boulevard, Bayfront Park and Museum Park on the east, the Miami River to the south, North 6th Street to the north, and Interstate 95 to the west. While it is technically Miami's official \"downtown\", the term \"Downtown Miami\" has come to refer to a much larger 3.8-square-mile (10 km2) area along the bay from the Rickenbacker Causeway to the Julia Tuttle Causeway."}}
