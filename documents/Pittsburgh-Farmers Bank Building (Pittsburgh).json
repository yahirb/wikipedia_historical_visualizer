{"Pittsburgh": {"Farmers Bank Building (Pittsburgh)": "The Farmers Bank Building was a 27-story, 105 m (344 ft) skyscraper in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania completed in 1902 and demolished on May 25, 1997. The University of Pittsburgh's online digital library states the building was constructed in 1903 and had 24 stories. To a generation of Pittsburgh sports fans the building is well remembered for being resurfaced in the mid 1960 in a failed rehabilitation but also fondly for a 15 story high mural of Roberto Clemente, Bill Mazeroski, Jack Lambert, Mean Joe Greene and Mario Lemieux completed in 1992 by Judy Penzer, who was killed in the crash of TWA Flight 800 four years later."}}
