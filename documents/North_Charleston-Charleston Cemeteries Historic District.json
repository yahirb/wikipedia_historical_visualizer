{"North_Charleston": {"Charleston Cemeteries Historic District": "The Charleston Cemeteries Historic District encompasses a cluster of 23 cemeteries north of downtown Charleston, South Carolina. Laid out on either side of Huguenin Street in the northern part of peninsular Charleston, they were laid out between 1849 and 1956, and represented a concentrated diversity in funerary art and cemetery landscape design practices. The oldest cemetery is Magnolia Cemetery, laid out in 1849 in the then-fashionable rural cemetery style."}}
