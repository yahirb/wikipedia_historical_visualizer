{"Green_Bay": {"Bellin Run": "The Bellin Run is a 10K (6.2-mile) race held annually on the east side of Green Bay, Wisconsin, just outside Bellin Memorial Hospital, the race's founding organization. The first Bellin 10K was held on June 12, 1977 and was known as the Bellin Heartwarming Run designed to promote cardiovascular fitness and wellness. The run was intended to be a one-time event to help celebrate the dedication of the hospital's newly constructed additions."}}
