{"Revere": {"Dock Square (Boston)": "Dock Square in downtown Boston, Massachusetts is a public square adjacent to Faneuil Hall, bounded by Congress Street, North Street, and the steps of the 60 State Street office tower. Its name derives from its original (17th-century) location at the waterfront. From the 1630s through the early 19th century, it served boats in the Boston Harbor as \"the common landing place, at Bendell's Cove,\" later called Town Dock."}}
