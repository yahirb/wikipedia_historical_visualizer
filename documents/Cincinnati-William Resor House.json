{"Cincinnati": {"William Resor House": "The William Resor House is a historic residence on Greendale Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built in 1843, this three-story building is distinguished by architectural elements such as a mansard roof, third-story dormer windows, and a large wrap-around verandah porch. The front of the house is a simple square, but its facade is broken up by the roofline of the porch, which includes a gazebo with a dome and cast iron decorations."}}
