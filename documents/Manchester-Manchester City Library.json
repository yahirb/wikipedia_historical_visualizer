{"Manchester": {"Manchester City Library": "The Manchester City Library was established in the mid-1850s, and serves the population of Manchester, the largest city in the state of New Hampshire. It is one of twelve libraries in the GMILCS consortium (Greater Manchester Integrated Library Cooperative System) that provides materials and services to the greater Manchester area, and is on the U.S. Department of Interior's National Register of Historic Places, listed under the Victory Park Historic District as a contributing property, one of the four buildings that face the park. Even though the current building was completed in 1914, library services were provided as early as 1844 through a membership-based organization known as the Manchester Atheneum, and then as a public library which was housed in two other buildings."}}
