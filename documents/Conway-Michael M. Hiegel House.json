{"Conway": {"Michael M. Hiegel House": "The Michael M. Hiegel House is a historic house at 504 Second Street in Conway, Arkansas. It is a picturesque 1-1/2 story structure, finished in brick and stucco and covered by a gable-on-hip roof. The main facade bays are articulated by brick pilasters, with the two right bays filled with round-arch windows, and the bay to their left housing the main entrance, deeply recessed under a similar rounded arch."}}
