{"Reno": {"Steamboat Creek (Nevada)": "Steamboat Creek drains Washoe Lake, flowing north to northeast through Truckee Meadows and finally intersecting the Truckee River, east of Reno Nevada. Historical documents indicate that in the early 1860s there were at least six mills reducing Comstock ore in Washoe Valley and during these earliest days of the Comstock mining.\nSteamboat Springs near Galena also drains into Steamboat Creek which was the location of Castle Peak mine."}}
