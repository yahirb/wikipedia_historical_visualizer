{"Newton": {"Thaddeus Jackson House": "The Thaddeus Jackson House is a historic house at 15 Alberta Road in Brookline, Massachusetts. Built in 1820, it is one of Brookline's older surviving houses, unusual because it was built in the Georgian style, then already out of fashion. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1985."}}
