{"Westminster": {"Hackberry Hill (Colorado)": "Hackberry Hill is a hill in northeast Arvada, Colorado between the Ralston Creek and Little Dry Creek watersheds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe top of this hill was the site of a lone hackberry tree which served as a landmark to early explorers and settlers of region. The tree was unusual, both for its location since the only other scattered trees in the area grew next to water, and because hackberry trees were not native to the region."}}
