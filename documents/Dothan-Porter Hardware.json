{"Dothan": {"Porter Hardware": "Porter Hardware, the oldest continually operating hardware store in the state of Alabama, was opened in 1889 by Edwin Russell Porter and Joel Murphree in the city of Dothan and is still operated today by Mr. Porter's descendants. The interior and exterior of Porter Hardware remains virtually unaltered and it maintains a large inventory of hardware and hard-to-find items."}}
