{"Alexandria": {"Hains Point": "Hains Point is located at the southern tip of East Potomac Park between the main branch of the Potomac River and the Washington Channel in southwest Washington, D.C. The land on which the park is located is sometimes described as a peninsula but is actually an island: the Washington Channel connects with the Tidal Basin north of the park and the Jefferson Memorial. The island is artificial: it was built up from Potomac dredging material from 1880 to 1892.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1920, Girl Scouts obtained permission to operate a \"tea house\" at the Hains Point Park in Washington D.C. Traveling by car was still a new adventure and the teahouse was a pleasant destination, offering refreshments and restrooms for tourists."}}
