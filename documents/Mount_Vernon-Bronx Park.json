{"Mount_Vernon": {"Bronx Park": "Bronx Park, laid out on 718 acres (2.91 km2) along the Bronx River in the Bronx, New York City, is the home of the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo. Bicycle paths go northwest, north, and east, along Mosholu Parkway, Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway respectively. The east end of Fordham Road is inside the park, at an interchange with the Pelham and Bronx River Parkways, and divides the park roughly in half, with the Botanical Garden occupying most of the north half and the Zoo most of the south."}}
