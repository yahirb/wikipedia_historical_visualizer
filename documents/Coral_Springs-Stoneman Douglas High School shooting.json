{"Coral_Springs": {"Stoneman Douglas High School shooting": "On the afternoon of February 14, 2018, a mass shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area. 17 people were killed and 15 more were taken to hospitals, making it one of the world's deadliest school massacres. The suspected perpetrator, Nikolas Jacob Cruz, was arrested shortly afterward and confessed to the shooting, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. He was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\nIn September 2017 it had been reported to the FBI that \"Nikolas Cruz\" had posted social media messages in which he stated his aspiration to become a \"professional school shooter\" with his AR-15 style rifle. In January 2018, a month prior to the shooting, the FBI received another tip, that Cruz had made a death threat, but due to an error, its Miami field office was never notified of this information. Police and prosecutors have not yet established a motive for the rampage and are looking into \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\"."}}
