{"Hoboken": {"The Kitchen": "The Kitchen is a non-profit, multi-disciplinary art and performance space located at 512 West 19th Street, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It was founded in Greenwich Village in 1971 by Steina and Woody Vasulka, taking its name from the original location, the kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center, where artists working mostly in video showed their work. Although first intended as a location for the exhibition of video art, The Kitchen soon expanded its mission to include other forms of art, both plastic and performance."}}
