{"North_Charleston": {"Robert Brewton House": "The Robert Brewton House is a historic house at 71 Church Street in Charleston, South Carolina. With a construction date at or before 1730, it is the oldest dated example of a \"single\" house. A single house is one room wide, with the narrow end towards the street, the better to catch cool breezes."}}
