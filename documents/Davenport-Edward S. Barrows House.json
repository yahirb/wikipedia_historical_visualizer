{"Davenport": {"Edward S. Barrows House": "The Edward S. Barrows House, also known as the Capital Apartments, is a historic building located just north of downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. The nomination form and the National Register erroneously attribute the house to Edward S. Barrows, as all other sources give his first name was Egbert."}}
