{"Lowell": {"Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic College for Boys": "Saint Joseph's Roman Catholic College for Boys, also known as Saint Joseph's High School, is a historic school building at 760 Merrimack Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The three story brick Romanesque Revival building was built in 1892 to a design by Irish-American church architect Patrick W. Ford. The school was one of a number of Roman Catholic institutions built to serve Lowell's burgeoning French-American community, a significant portion of which had settled in \"The Acre\", as the neighborhood is known."}}
