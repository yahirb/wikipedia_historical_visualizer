{"Skokie": {"Uptown Broadway Building": "The Uptown Broadway Building is a historic three-story building at 4703\u20134715 North Broadway in Uptown, Chicago. Built in 1926, it was designed by Walter W. Ahlschlager and is known for its ornate terra-cotta facade, depicting ancient gods, rams' heads, shields, helmets, birds, fruits, and trophies. Lynn Becker of the Chicago Reader has called the exterior \"a riotous, Spanish-baroque-inspired hallucination\"."}}
