{"St._George": {"Washington Cotton Factory": "The Washington Cotton Factory was built in 1865-67 on Mill Creek near Washington, Utah by Mormon settlers to process locally-grown cotton for use by the settlers. The region of the Virgin River valley became known among Mormons as the \"Cotton Mission,\" a project envisioned by Brigham Young to establish Mormon self-sufficiency.\nThe mill encountered difficulties in finding a reliable supply of raw cotton and suffered from an erratic water flow."}}
