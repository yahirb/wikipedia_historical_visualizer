{"Cleveland": {"Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum": "The Steamship William G. Mather (Official Number 224850) is a retired Great Lakes bulk freighter now restored as a museum ship in Cleveland, Ohio, one of four in the Great Lakes region. She transported cargo such as ore, coal, stone, and grain to ports throughout the Great Lakes, and was nicknamed \"The Ship That Built Cleveland\" because Cleveland's steel mills were a frequent destination.\nNote: from 1905 till 1925 the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company had another vessel named S.S. William G. Mather (O.N. 202542) in their fleet, also built by Great Lakes Engineering Works."}}
