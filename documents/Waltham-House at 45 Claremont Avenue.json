{"Waltham": {"House at 45 Claremont Avenue": "The House at 45 Claremont Avenue in Arlington, Massachusetts is a rare local example of transitional Italianate and Gothic Revival styling. Built c. 1885-90, the house has steeply pitched gables and almost Stick style porch decoration that are typical Gothic work, while the house's massing and the bracketed eaves are Italianate."}}
