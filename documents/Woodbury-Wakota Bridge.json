{"Woodbury": {"Wakota Bridge": "The Wakota Bridge is a ten-lane bridge on Interstate 494 between South St. Paul and Newport, Minnesota across the Mississippi River, replacing a four-lane span built in 1959. The name was given to the previous span in the early 1960s, and is derived from the two counties it connects, Washington and Dakota."}}
