{"Richmond": {"Sobrante Ridge Regional Preserve": "Sobrante Ridge Regional Preserve (SRRP) is a regional park in Contra Costa County, California near Richmond and is part of the East Bay Regional Parks (EBRPD) system. The park may be best known as habitat for the Alameda manzanita, which is deemed extremely rare, according to EBRPD.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land on which SRRP lies was once part of the Rancho El Sobrante grant that the government of Mexico gave to Juan Jose Castro. Although the cited source gives 1840 as the date of the grant, several other sources say that the grant was made in 1841."}}
