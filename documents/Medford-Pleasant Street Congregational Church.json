{"Medford": {"Pleasant Street Congregational Church": "The Pleasant Street Congregational Church is an historic Congregational church at 75 Pleasant Street in Arlington, Massachusetts. The church was built in 1844 for a congregation that split doctrinally from the First Parish Church, whose adherents chose to become Unitarian. The church is a fine example of pattern-book Greek Revival architecture."}}
