{"Henderson": {"Railroad Pass (Nevada)": "Railroad Pass, 2367 ft (721.46 m), is a mountain pass through the Black Hills of the River Mountains in the southeastern portion of the city of Henderson, Nevada, which is part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Traversed by the Union Pacific Railroad's Boulder City spur of the Henderson branch line and by the Boulder Highway (US 93/US 95), the pass connects Henderson with Boulder City.\nIn 1998, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) paved over the at-grade crossing of the railroad tracks on Boulder Highway. The sharp skew angle (64 degrees) at this junction, high speeds on the highway, and little to no rail usage made this dangerous crossing a prime candidate for elimination. However, the historical significance of this rail spur and future potential for use by excursion and/or commuter trains merited its preservation. The initial phase of NDOT's Boulder City Bypass project will result in a new grade separation of the highway by 2015, allowing the rails to be reconnected so trains can once again reach Boulder City via Railroad Pass.\nThe Railroad Pass Hotel/Casino, is sited along Boulder Highway on the south side of the pass. Opened in 1931, it is one of the oldest casinos still operating in Nevada."}}
