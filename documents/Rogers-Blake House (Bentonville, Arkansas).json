{"Rogers": {"Blake House (Bentonville, Arkansas)": "The Blake House was a historic house at 211 Southeast A Street in Bentonville, Arkansas. It was a two-story wood frame duplex, with entirely vernacular styling, except for a Craftsman-style porch (with tapered square columns set on stone piers) added in the 20th century. The house, estimated to have been built in the 1880s, was a remarkably well-preserved example of a once-numerous building type in the city."}}
