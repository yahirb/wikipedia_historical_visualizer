{"Lynn": {"Vamp Building": "The Vamp Building is a historic factory building at 3-15 Liberty Square in downtown Lynn, Massachusetts. The eight story brick building was built in 1903 to a design by local architect Henry Warren Rogers, and was extended over the next four years to occupy the entire city block bounded by Washington Street, Union Street, and Liberty Square. The \"flatiron\" V-shape of the building may have been a reason for its name."}}
