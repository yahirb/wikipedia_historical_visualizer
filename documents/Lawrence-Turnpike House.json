{"Lawrence": {"Turnpike House": "The Turnpike House was a historic house at 314 Broadway in Methuen, Massachusetts. It was a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with a side gable roof and a granite foundation, with two interior chimneys. The main entrance was flanked by full-length sidelight windows, and a two-story wing was added to its rear early in the 20th century."}}
