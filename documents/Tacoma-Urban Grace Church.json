{"Tacoma": {"Urban Grace Church": "Urban Grace Church, formerly First Baptist Church, was built in a Gothic Revival style in 1924 by Heath, Gove and Bell (see Frederick Heath) in Tacoma, Washington. The building's 53 rooms include an auditorium with 1,250 seats, a 500-seat banquet hall with stage, a kitchen, nursery room, small chapel, choir rooms, and the pastor's study. It is believed to be the oldest continuously used location for Christian religious services in the city."}}
