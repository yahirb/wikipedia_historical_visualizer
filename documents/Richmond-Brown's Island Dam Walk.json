{"Richmond": {"Brown's Island Dam Walk": "The Brown's Island Dam Walk, also known as the VEPCO Levee Dam is a structure across the James River in Richmond, Virginia that connects Brown's Island to the James River Parks System on the Manchester side of the river. It was originally constructed as a dam in 1901 by the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) (now known as Dominion Power). The original purpose for the 31.5 ft (9.6 m) tall structure was to divert water into the Haxall Canal where it was received by the 12th Street Power Station until its decommissioning in 1968."}}
