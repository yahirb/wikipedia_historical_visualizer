{"Mountain_View": {"J. Henry Meyer Memorial Library": "The J. Henry Meyer Memorial Library was one of several libraries at Stanford University in California. The library was dedicated on December 2, 1966. In 2007, a seismic assessment identified $45 million in required retrofits, more than the cost of a new library elsewhere on campus."}}
