{"Sacramento": {"William Coleman Memorial Fountain": "The William Coleman Memorial Fountain is a stone fountain located in Cesar Chavez Plaza, 10th and J Street, Sacramento, California created by sculptor Ralph Stackpole.\nFlorence Coleman bequeathed $30,000 to the city of Sacramento with which to erect a fountain in the memory of her late husband, William Coleman. Her chosen sculptor Amanda Austin was picked in 1916 to create it, but she died a year later and it was another decade before Stackpole's work was unveiled."}}
