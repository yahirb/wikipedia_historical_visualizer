{"Pawtucket": {"Tower-Flagg Barn Complex": "The Tower-Flagg Barn Complex is (or was) a historic site in Cumberland, Rhode Island at 100 Abbott Run Valley Road. Its most significant feature was a barn complex whose oldest section was an English barn that was probably constructed in the second half of the 18th century. If so, it would have been built by Benjamin Tower, whose family owned the land from the late 17th century into the early 19th century."}}
