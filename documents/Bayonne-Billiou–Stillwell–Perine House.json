{"Bayonne": {"Billiou\u2013Stillwell\u2013Perine House": "The Billiou\u2013Stillwell\u2013Perine House is a Dutch Colonial structure and the oldest standing building on Staten Island, New York.\nThe house was originally built by Pierre Billiou, a Huguenot who arrived at New Amsterdam fleeing religious persecution in Europe in 1661. He founded Oude Dorp (Old Town) in the same year, and subsequently received a land grant on Staten Island, erecting the original stone section of the house about 1662."}}
