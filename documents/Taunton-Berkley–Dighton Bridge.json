{"Taunton": {"Berkley\u2013Dighton Bridge": "The fourth Berkley\u2013Dighton Bridge is a four-span concrete arch bridge with closed spandrel walls of cast-in-place concrete, using pile-supported abutments and piers. The bridge was made such that it appears to be constructed of stone masonry rather than concrete. The two end spans are 74 feet (23 m) and the two center spans are 92 feet (28 m) for a total bridge length of approximately 350 feet (110 m)."}}
