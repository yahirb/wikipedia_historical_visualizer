{"Madison": {"W23BW-D": "W23BW-D is a translator station on channel 23 in Madison, Wisconsin owned by HC2 Holdings and carrying programming from the Three Angels Broadcasting Network (3ABN) with no programming originating locally. Formerly on channel 54 until 2001, it was moved to channel 23 in 2001 to accommodate the digital signal of WREX in Rockford, Illinois; WREX moved its digital signal to its permanent digital 13 in 2009, and channel 54 has since been removed from the television bandplan.\nW23BW-D's signal is nulled to the north, a remnant of the analog age when Rockford's WIFR broadcast on analog channel 23 (currently WIFR is on digital channel 41, but identifies as channel 23 via PSIP)."}}
