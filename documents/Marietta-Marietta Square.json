{"Marietta": {"Marietta Square": "Marietta Square, also called Glover Park, is a park and traditional city center in Marietta, Georgia, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Cobb County courthouse burned in 1848, Mayor John Glover donated the land to the city on the condition that it would stay a park or return to its heirs. Since then, the new courthouse has moved to its existing location, across the street from the southeast corner of the park."}}
