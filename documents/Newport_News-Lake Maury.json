{"Newport_News": {"Lake Maury": "Lake Maury is a reservoir which was created as part of the natural park on the grounds of the Mariners' Museum located in the independent city of Newport News in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia.\nThe museum was founded in 1932 by Archer Milton Huntington, son of Collis P. Huntington, a railroad builder who brought the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway to Warwick County, Virginia, and who founded the City of Newport News, its coal export facilities, and Newport News Shipbuilding in the late 19th century.\nArcher and his wife, the sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, acquired 800 acres (3.2 km\u00b2) of land that would come to hold 61,000 square feet (5,700 m\u00b2) of exhibition galleries, a research library, a 167-acre (676,000 m\u00b2) lake, a five-mile (8 km) shoreline trail with fourteen bridges, and over 35,000 maritime artifacts from around the globe."}}
