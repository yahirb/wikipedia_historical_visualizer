{"Montgomery": {"Greyhound Bus Station (Montgomery, Alabama)": "The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama, was the site of a violent attack on participants in the 1961 Freedom Ride during the Civil Rights Movement. The May 1961 assaults, carried out by a mob of white protesters who confronted the civil rights activists, \"shocked the nation and led the Kennedy Administration to side with civil rights protesters for the first time.\"\nThe property is no longer used as a bus station, but the building was saved from demolition and its facade has been restored. The site was leased by the Alabama Historical Commission and a historical marker was located in front of the building."}}
