{"Bayonne": {"Graniteville, Staten Island": "Graniteville is the name of a neighborhood in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nGraniteville was originally named Bennett's Corners and Fayetteville. Quarries for trap rock were operated in the area from 1841 to 1896, leading to the community's name being changed first to Granite Village, then Graniteville.\nLargely rural well into the 20th century, Graniteville was the scene of a notable fire in March 1942, when an explosion at the Consolidated Fireworks Company on Richmond Avenue claimed the lives of five employees."}}
