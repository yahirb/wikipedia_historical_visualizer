{"Minneapolis": {"Gold Medal Park": "Gold Medal Park is a 7.5-acre (3.0 ha) park in the Downtown East neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. Designed by landscape architect Tom Oslund, the park is owned by the city of Minneapolis and opened in May 2007. It takes its inspiration from the Native American mounds that are found throughout Minnesota, and its name from Gold Medal flour, a product of General Mills."}}
