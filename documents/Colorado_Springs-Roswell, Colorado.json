{"Colorado_Springs": {"Roswell, Colorado": "Roswell, now annexed into the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was a coal mine settlement near the northern bluffs of Colorado Springs and a 19th-century railroad junction. The town was located at roughly the present intersection of Fillmore Street and North Nevada Avenue in Colorado Springs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe town of Roswell, built 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of Colorado Springs in 1889, was named for a man from New York, Governor Roswell P. Flower, who felt that Colorado Springs' climate was only second to Saranac, New York for its curative benefits for tuberculosis patients."}}
