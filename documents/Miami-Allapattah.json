As of May 2011, the county-owned portion of Allapattah, from State Road 9 to LeJeune Road, is being annexed by the city proper.\nThe neighborhood was nicknamed Little Santo Domingo in 2003 an effort spurred by former Miami mayor and longtime city commissioner Wilfredo \"Willy\" Gort to honor the sizable Dominican American population in the community."}}
