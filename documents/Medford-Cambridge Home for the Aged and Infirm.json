{"Medford": {"Cambridge Home for the Aged and Infirm": "The Cambridge Home for the Aged and Infirm is an historic building on 650 Concord Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built in 1928 by the city, it is one of the oldest surviving municipal facilities for the housing of elderly and incurably ill patients, rather than indigents. It is now operated as Neville Place, an assisted living community managed by Senior Living Residences."}}
