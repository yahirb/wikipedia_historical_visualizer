{"Yorba_Linda": {"Carbon Canyon Regional Park": "Carbon Canyon Regional Park (or simply Carbon Canyon Park) is a regional park in Brea, California that was created after the Carbon Canyon Creek was dammed. It links up with Chino Hills State Park on the East side. The park also is home to a small forest of Redwood trees, which have been struggling to survive since the start of the 2010 California drought."}}
