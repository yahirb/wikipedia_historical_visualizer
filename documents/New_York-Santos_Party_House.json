{"New_York": {"Santos Party House": "Santos Party House was a New York City nightclub located at 96 Lafayette Street between Walker and White Streets in the TriBeCa neighborhood of downtown Manhattan. Originally named the \"Lafayette Street Jungle Gym\", Santos Party House was recognized as the \"Best New Nightclub\" by Paper magazine's Annual Nightlife Awards, and has also won awards for its parties, sound system, lighting, and dance floor.\nThe nightclub was a two-level, 8,000-square-foot (740 m2) music venue designed by Ronald Castellano to function as a concert hall, dance club, and lounge. It took the partners, including noted musician Andrew W.K., three years to acquire a cabaret license and finish the creation of the space, with the downstairs space opening on May 14, 2008, and the upstairs space opening on June 1, 2008. In total, the venue features three bars, black walls and ceilings, dark wood floors, tall columns, and an array of ever-changing decorations.\nSantos Party House's last night of operation was May 29, 2016 which means they are now out of business."}}
