{"Raleigh": {"State Bank of North Carolina": "The State Bank of North Carolina is the oldest surviving commercial building in Raleigh, North Carolina and was the first state-sponsored banking institution constructed in North Carolina. The bank was incorporated in 1810, but during the War of 1812 cash was moved inland to banks in Raleigh and Tarboro for fears that the British Army would attack the coast. The increase in money deposits resulted in the State Bank's construction in 1813."}}
