{"Jersey_City": {"PJP Landfill": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency added the PJP Landfill site in Marion Section of Jersey City, New Jersey  to the Superfund National Priorities List on September 1, 1983 because hazardous chemicals were found in the soil and groundwater. The 87 acre site located in Hudson County contained a landfill that may have been used as early as 1968 to dispose of chemical and industrial wastes. In 1971 the State certified the landfill to receive solid wastes."}}
