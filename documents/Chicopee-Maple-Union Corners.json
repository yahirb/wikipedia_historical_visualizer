{"Chicopee": {"Maple-Union Corners": "Maple-Union Corners is a historic district centered at the intersection of Maple and Union Streets in Springfield, Massachusetts. The area is prominent as the location of the Springfield Female Seminary building (77 Maple Street, built 1832, now in residential use), and for the distinctive homes of several of Springfield's prominent 19th century citizens. The house at 83 Maple Street, was first owned by Solomon Merrick, inventor of the monkey wrench, and was later owned by Ansel Phelps, the fourth mayor of Springfield."}}
