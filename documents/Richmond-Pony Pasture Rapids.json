{"Richmond": {"Pony Pasture Rapids": "Pony Pasture Rapids (also commonly referred as Pony Pasture) is a section of the James River Park System that runs alongside the City of Richmond, VA. Nestled on the south bank of the James River downstream from the Huguenot Bridge, Pony Pasture is known for its local attractions of hiking, swimming, kayaking, and fishing. It has become a place for the residents of Richmond to experience the outdoors without having to leave town. With the help of park volunteers and funding from recycling projects, access to the rapids was made possible."}}
