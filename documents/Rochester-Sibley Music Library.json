{"Rochester": {"Sibley Music Library": "Sibley Music Library is the library of the Eastman School of Music, Rochester, NY. It was founded in 1904 by Hiram Watson Sibley in honor of his father Hiram Sibley and is currently the largest university music library in the US.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe library was originally placed in University of Rochester's Sibley Hall serving as both community and university music library. In January 1922 the then-small collection was moved from its original home to the newly instituted Eastman School of Music in central Rochester.\nBy 1937 the library had outgrown its space within the Eastman School premises, and an annex was erected at 44 Swan Street, the adjacent block."}}
