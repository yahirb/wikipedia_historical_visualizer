{"New_York": {"Home Insurance Plaza": "Home Insurance Plaza is a 630 ft (190 m) tall skyscraper in New York City, New York. It was completed in 1966 and has 44 floors. Alfred Easton Poor designed the building, which is the 61st tallest in New York. The building's plaza had a redevelopment in 1987 by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\nThe plaza is the home of \u201cLiberty,\u201d a 75 x 50 foot mural by Julie Harvey (artist). Simple in its concept, it illustrates that New York's present was built upon the foundations its forefathers placed many years ago. The Statue of Liberty is reflected in the mirrored facade of a skyscraper. Early 19th century New York emerges revealing the cobblestone streets, horses and carriages, gentlemen with top hats, and ships in the seaport. Ms. Harvey has also included the old shipping barrels, lamp posts and even pigs that ran freely around Lower Manhattan. The Liberty Mural was presented to the community as a visual expression of the foundations on which New York was established."}}
