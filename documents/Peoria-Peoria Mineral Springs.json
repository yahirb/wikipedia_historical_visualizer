{"Peoria": {"Peoria Mineral Springs": "Peoria Mineral Springs is 14,500-year-old natural spring in the city of Peoria, Illinois, United States. The site, also known as Spring Hill, is located on a hillside on the historic West Bluff. In 1843, a \"cave-like barrel-vaulted brick reservoir\" was constructed; the structure is concealed within the hillside and captures the flow of three separate springs."}}
