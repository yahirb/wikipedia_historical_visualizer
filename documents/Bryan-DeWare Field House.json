{"Bryan": {"DeWare Field House": "The Charles DeWare Field House was a gymnasium on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. The building was the first gymnasium built on the campus, and served as the home of the men's basketball team from 1924 to 1954, when G. Rollie White Coliseum opened just down the street. It was located on Joe Routt Boulevard, to the northwest of Kyle Field, and was a brick building with a peaked roof, arched windows and wooden bleachers."}}
