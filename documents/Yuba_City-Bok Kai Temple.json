{"Yuba_City": {"Bok Kai Temple": "The Bok Kai Temple (\u5317\u6eaa\u5edf) is a traditional Chinese temple in the city of Marysville, California, located at the corner of D and First Streets, and served as the center of what was a bustling Chinatown for a small town.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1854, five years after the first contingent of Chinese arrived in California to work the gold mines during the California Gold Rush, a temple was erected in Marysville to serve the immigrant population. The foremost of the gods that are worshiped is Xuan Wu, (\u7384\u6b66 \"Dark Warrior\" or \"Mysterious Warrior\"), a deity in Chinese religion believed to govern the north and rain, hence its place of reverence at Bok Kai Temple, or northern creek temple."}}
