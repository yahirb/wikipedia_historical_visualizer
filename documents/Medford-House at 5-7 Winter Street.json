{"Medford": {"House at 5-7 Winter Street": "The House at 5-7 Winter Street in Arlington, Massachusetts is a rare late-19th century two family house in East Arlington. The wood frame house was built in 1895 by John Squires, who owned a garden farm. It was built as a speculative venture at a time before Arlington's market gardeners began selling their land off for development."}}
