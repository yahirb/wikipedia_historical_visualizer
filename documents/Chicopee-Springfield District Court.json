{"Chicopee": {"Springfield District Court": "Springfield District Court, now the City Hall Annex, is a historic former courthouse at 1600 E. Columbus Avenue in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Neo-Classical building was constructed beginning in 1929 to replace the previous police court, which was outgrowing its quarters. The new building, built of steel and concrete with marble interiors, served as a district court facility, serving a diversity of court needs for Springfield and surrounding communities."}}
