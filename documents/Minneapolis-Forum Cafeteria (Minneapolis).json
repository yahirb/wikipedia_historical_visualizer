{"Minneapolis": {"Forum Cafeteria (Minneapolis)": "The Minneapolis Forum Cafeteria was located at 36 South 7th Street originally constructed in 1914 as the Saxe Theater, later the Strand Theater. A 1930 reconstruction created a cafeteria with a stunning Art Deco interior of black onyx and pale green tiles, sconces, chandeliers, and mirrors with a Minnesota-themed motif: pine cones, waterfalls, and Viking ships.\nThe cafeteria did not outlive the era of fast food and closed its doors in August 1975."}}
