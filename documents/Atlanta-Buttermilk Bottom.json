{"Atlanta": {"Buttermilk Bottom": "Buttermilk Bottom, also known as Buttermilk Bottoms or Black Bottom, was an African-American neighborhood in central Atlanta, centered on the area where the Atlanta Civic Center now stands in the Old Fourth Ward. It was considered a slum area, having unpaved streets and no electricity.\nThe name may refer to\nthe downward slope of the sewers in the area, which caused the backed-up water to have a buttermilk smell\nresidents being unable to afford \"sweet\" milk, or fresh milk, and instead drinking sour, older milk, which was cultured to add longevity and shelf life to the product in the era prior to modern refrigeration\n\n\n== History ==\nMost of Buttermilk Bottom was razed in the 1960s to make way for urban redevelopment projects, most notably Atlanta's convention center (built 1967), now the Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center."}}
