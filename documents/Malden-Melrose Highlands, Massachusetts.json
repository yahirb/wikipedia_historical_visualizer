{"Malden": {"Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts": "Melrose Highlands is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Melrose, Massachusetts. Formerly part of neighboring Stoneham, it became part of Melrose in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Its zip code was 02177, before the Highlands post office was closed; the Melrose zip code of 02176 is now used, although mail marked as 02177 is still deliverable."}}
