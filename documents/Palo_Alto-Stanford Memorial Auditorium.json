{"Palo_Alto": {"Stanford Memorial Auditorium": "Memorial Hall (usually called Memorial Auditorium, or MemAud by current students), dedicated in 1937, commemorates those students and faculty from Stanford who died in World War I. Designed by Arthur Brown, Jr. in conjunction with Bakewell and Weihe, construction of the building was funded primarily through student contributions. Prominent features of the building include a great central arched entry, large arched entries on the sides, covered colonnades on the sides, bare wall surfaces in rectangular segments, and a red tile roof typical of many Stanford buildings."}}
