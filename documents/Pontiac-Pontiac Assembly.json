{"Pontiac": {"Pontiac Assembly": "Pontiac Assembly was one of four General Motors assembly plants in Pontiac, Michigan located along Baldwin Avenue. It served as the main facility for Pontiac Motor Division since it was built in 1927. It is across the street from the currently operational Pontiac Metal Center, which was the original location for the Oakland Motor Car Company, which Pontiac evolved into."}}
