{"Camden": {"Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal": "The Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal is the primary intercity bus station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia, immediately north of The Gallery at Market East shopping mall and the SEPTA Regional Rail Jefferson Station, a few hundred feet east of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and Reading Terminal Market, a few hundred feet south of the Trocadero Theatre and the south edge of Philadelphia's Chinatown district, and within 1/2 mile of Independence Mall, the U.S. Mint, and City Hall. The station building, which underwent an interior remodeling in early 2007, is relatively small and nondescript, belying its importance as one of the busiest, long distance, bus-only terminals in the United States."}}
