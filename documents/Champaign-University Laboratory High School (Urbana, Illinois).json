{"Champaign": {"University Laboratory High School (Urbana, Illinois)": "The University of Illinois Laboratory High School, known as Uni, or Uni High, was established in 1921 and is a laboratory school located on the engineering section of the University of Illinois campus in Urbana, Illinois. Its enrollment is approximately 300 students, spanning five years (the traditional grades 9-12, preceded by a composite 7th and 8th grade year known as the \"subfreshman\" year). The school is notable for the achievements of its alumni, including three Nobel laureates, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and a winner of Rupaul's Drag Race; in 2006 and 2008 it was recognized as a \"public elite\" school by Newsweek because of its students' high scores on the SAT. Before the recent change in the SAT's format, the average average SAT score was 2045, and now varies from 1400 to 1600."}}
