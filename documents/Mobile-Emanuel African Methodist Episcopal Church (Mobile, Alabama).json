{"Mobile": {"Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Mobile, Alabama)": "Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation in Mobile, Alabama, United States. Emanuel AME began when church trustees purchased a vacant lot for their church in 1869, as African Americans in Mobile established their own congregations following the American Civil War. The trustees completed a frame building in that same year."}}
