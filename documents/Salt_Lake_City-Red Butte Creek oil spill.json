{"Salt_Lake_City": {"Red Butte Creek oil spill": "The Red Butte Creek oil spill was caused by a rupture in a medium crude oil pipeline that occurred on June 11 and 12 2010. The Chevron Pipeline (CPL) is 10 inches in diameter and runs from western Colorado to a Chevron Corporation oil refinery near Salt Lake City Utah. A half inch diameter hole in the pipeline was caused by an electrical arc from high voltage power lines to a metal fence post buried a few inches above the pipeline."}}
