{"Durham": {"11 foot 8 Bridge": "The 11 foot 8 Bridge (formally known as the Norfolk Southern\u2013Gregson Street Overpass and nicknamed The Can-Opener) is a railroad bridge in Durham, North Carolina, United States, that has attracted media coverage and popular attention because tall vehicles such as trucks and RVs frequently collide with the unusually low overpass, resulting in damage ranging from RV roof air conditioners being scraped off to entire truck roofs being removed. The 78-year-old bridge along South Gregson Street provides only 11 feet 8 inches (3.56 m) of vertical clearance. It cannot be raised, because nearby railroad crossings would also have to be raised with it."}}
