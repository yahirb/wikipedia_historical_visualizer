{"Brookhaven": {"Concourse at Landmark Center": "Built in phases between 1984 and 1991, the Concourse at Landmark Center is a real estate development in metro Atlanta's Perimeter Center business district, in the city of Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States. It is a 70 acre planned community with two 34-story office towers, several low-rise office buildings, a hotel, and a health club, all set in landscaped grounds around a man-made lake.\nSet at the northeastern corner of the junction of two of Atlanta's busiest highways (Interstate 285 and Georgia 400), the Concourse, with its blue glass towers, was a major addition to the Atlanta skyline for commuters traveling to and from the north side of suburban Atlanta."}}
