{"Bellevue": {"South Omaha, Nebraska": "South Omaha is a former city and current district of Omaha, Nebraska, United States. During its initial development phase the town's nickname was \"The Magic City\" because of the seemingly overnight growth, due to the rapid development of the Union Stockyards. Annexed by the City of Omaha in 1915, the community has numerous historical landmarks many are within the South Omaha Main Street Historic District."}}
