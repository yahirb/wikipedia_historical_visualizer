{"Pomona": {"John R. Rodman Arboretum": "The John R. Rodman Arboretum (10 acres, or 40,000 m\u00b2) is located on the campus of Pitzer College in Claremont, eastern Los Angeles County, California.\nThe Arboretum began in 1984 when Dr. John R. Rodman, Professor of Environmental Studies, and Dr. Sheryl F. Miller, Professor of Anthropology, along with other faculty, staff, and students, tried to save surviving native chaparral vegetation from demolition by well-meaning academic developers. Since 1988 the arboretum has been an official part of the college."}}
