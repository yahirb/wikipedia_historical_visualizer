{"Duluth": {"1920 Duluth lynchings": "On June 15, 1920, three African American circus workers, Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie, suspects in an assault case, were taken from the jail, attacked, and lynched by a white mob of thousands in Duluth, Minnesota. Rumors had circulated that six African Americans had raped and robbed a nineteen-year-old girl. A physician's examination of her subsequently found no evidence of rape or assault."}}
