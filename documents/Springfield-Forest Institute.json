{"Springfield": {"Forest Institute": "The School of Professional Psychology at Forest Institute was founded in 1979 to provide an alternative to the traditional teaching Doctor of Psychology programs of education. The programs were designed for individuals desiring an education to prepare them to serve as direct providers of mental health services rather than researchers or academicians. Programs emphasize a holistic approach to mental wellness grounded in the science and practice of clinical psychology."}}
