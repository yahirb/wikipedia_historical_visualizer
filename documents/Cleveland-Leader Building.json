{"Cleveland": {"Leader Building": "The Leader Building is a 1913-completed 199 foot, 15 story, 322,600-square-foot high-rise located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio's Public Square district. It sits along the heavily travelled Superior Avenue. The building is named after the former Cleveland daily newspaper, \"The Leader\" which was founded by Edwin Cowles in 1854 and ran until it was sold to the Plain Dealer in 1917. The building is an excellent example of beaux arts architecture style, which was very popular at the time of its erection.\nThe building was sold to the K&D Management real estate property group, which controls substantial holdings in Northeast Ohio. The firm has intimated that they will turn the mostly vacate building into an apartment block, which will serve to further foment the burgeoning downtown frenzy to live in urban settings. The Leader property went for $5.4 million, though K&D's renovations will probably cost much more than that as it has lived most of its long life as an office and retail tower."}}
