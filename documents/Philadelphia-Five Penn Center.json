{"Philadelphia": {"Five Penn Center": "Five Penn Center is a 36-story highrise in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is part of the Penn Center complex designed by Edmund Bacon. The building was one of the tallest in the city until the highrise building boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s and is connected via underground concourse to Suburban Station, as are all buildings in the complex.\nIt was designed by Emery Roth & Sons and Vincent G. Kling (who also designed the Philadelphia Mint).\nIn 1986, several buildings of the Penn Center complex were renamed to their street addresses and Five Penn was no exception. Looking to get an edge up, being the largest of the Penn Center buildings and directly across Market Street from One Liberty Place, which was rising at the time, building landlords offered rental space at $16.01 a year per square foot, a marketing ploy for the building based on its address, 1601.\nToday, major tenants include The Neat Company, KPMG and The Radian Group. The building's lobby underwent remodeling in the summer of 2006."}}
