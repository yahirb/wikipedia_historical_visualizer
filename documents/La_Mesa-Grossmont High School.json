{"La_Mesa": {"Grossmont High School": "Grossmont High School is the oldest high school in San Diego's east county, California. Its mascot is the Foothiller, so chosen because, at the time of the school\u2019s construction, east county was much more isolated from the rest of San Diego than it is today and was often referred to as the boondocks or the foothills. Grossmont is in the Grossmont Union High School District."}}
