{"Bellevue": {"Eastlake, Seattle": "Eastlake is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, so named because of its location on the eastern shore of Lake Union. Its main thoroughfare is Eastlake Avenue E., which runs from Howell Street at the northeast corner of Downtown north over the University Bridge to the University District, where it connects to Roosevelt Way N.E. and 11th Avenue N.E. A second thoroughfare is Boylston Avenue E.; as an arterial, it parallels Interstate 5 for the four blocks between E. Newton Street to the south and E. Roanoke Street to the north, acting as an extension of Capitol Hill's Lakeview Boulevard E.\nEastlake is bounded on the west by Lake Union; on the north by Portage Bay, beyond which is the University District; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is Capitol Hill; and on the south by E. Garfield Street, beyond which is the Cascade neighborhood.\nVictor Steinbrueck wrote of the neighborhood in 1962 that it was \"progressing from a generally mediocre residential community to one of apartments and small business and offices.\"\nThe neighborhood contains a mixture of residential buildings, both houses and apartments, and small businesses, especially on Eastlake Avenue."}}
