{"Huntington_Park": {"One Wilshire": "One Wilshire is an office building located at the junction of Wilshire Boulevard and South Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles. Built in 1966, the thirty story high-rise was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and for its first decades in existence it was used almost exclusively by law firms. In the early 1990s it began housing largely telecommunications companies, and in 1992 One Wilshire underwent a major renovation, with the improvements largely related to telecommunication network upgrades."}}
