{"Duluth": {"SS Meteor (1896)": "SS Meteor is the sole surviving ship of the unconventional \"whaleback\" design. The design, created by Scottish captain Alexander McDougall, enabled her to carry a maximum amount of cargo with a minimum of draft. Meteor was built in 1896 in Superior, Wisconsin, United States, and, with a number of modifications, sailed until 1969."}}
