{"Hammond": {"WPWX": "WPWX (92.3 FM) is an Urban Contemporary radio station licensed to Hammond, Indiana and serving the Chicago market in addition to northwest Indiana, and is owned by Crawford Broadcasting. The station broadcasts from a transmitter a few hundred feet west of the Illinois/Indiana state line in Burnham, Illinois, with studios on Calumet Avenue in Hammond.\nWPWX's urban format debuted in the spring of 2001 in an attempt to go head to head with the longtime urban radio leader in Chicago, WGCI-FM (Crawford Broadcasting previously had a Christian talk format on the 92.3 frequency for over 40 years under the call letters WYCA)."}}
