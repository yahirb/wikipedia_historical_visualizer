{"Racine": {"Mitchell Lewis Building": "The Mitchell Lewis Building is a historic building in Racine, Wisconsin, and a former office building and automobile factory for the Mitchell Motor Company. Designed by the local architectural firm of Guilbert and Funston, it was built in 1910 at 815 Eighth Street, alongside the Chicago and North Western railroad track. After the Mitchell company went out of business in 1923, the factory was used by Nash Motors until 1929, when it was sold to the J.I. Case company, which used it as a warehouse."}}
