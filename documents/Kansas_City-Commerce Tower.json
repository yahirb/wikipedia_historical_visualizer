{"Kansas_City": {"Commerce Tower": "Commerce Tower is a 30-story skyscraper located in Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, USA. Constructed in 1965, it is the ninth-tallest habitable structure in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, and since the completion of the City Hall, it was the first locally designed Skyscraper in Kansas City. The facade is constructed of pre-cast stone and glass, (known as a \"curtain-wall\") creating a unique look, especially for its time. When it opened, its top two floors were home to the Top of the Tower restaurant, which served five varieties of ethnic cuisine in separate dining areas decorated to match the food served there."}}
