{"Quincy": {"Buildings at 825-829 Blue Hill Avenue": "The Buildings at 825-829 Blue Hill Avenue are historic apartment buildings in the Mattapan neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The three-story Colonial Revival masonry structures were designed by Samuel Levy and built in 1924 for Herman Barron, during a period in which Boston's Jewish population migrated to the area in large numbers from downtown Boston. The buildings occupy a triangular lot at the corner of Blue Hill Avenue and Calder Street."}}
