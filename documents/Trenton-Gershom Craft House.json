{"Trenton": {"Gershom Craft House": "The Gershom Craft House (c.1806-1808), also known as Pomona Farm, is a historical house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River about 2 miles from Trenton, New Jersey.\nThe house is as excellent an example of Federal style architecture as is found in Bucks County, combining the vernacular with Federalist ideals of proportion and decoration. The four main rooms of the house are each approximately 18 feet (5.5 m) square by nine feet high."}}
