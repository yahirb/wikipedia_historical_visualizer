{"North_Charleston": {"Carolina Rifles Armory": "The Carolina Rifles Armory at 158-160 King St., Charleston, South Carolina, was a late 19th-century headquarters for a semi-private military group, but today only the fa\u00e7ade remains, facing an annex for the Charleston Library Society.\nThe Carolina Rifles were a semi-private military group organized in 1869 during Reconstruction when armed military units were banned. The group ostensibly served social functions but was also expected by Confederate veterans to serve extra-police purposes."}}
