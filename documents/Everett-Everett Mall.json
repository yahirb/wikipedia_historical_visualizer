{"Everett": {"Everett Mall": "Everett Mall is a 673,000-square-foot (62,500 m2) indoor/outdoor shopping mall located in Everett, Washington, USA. Planned in the late 1960s, the mall began with the construction of two anchor stores, Sears in 1969 and White Front in 1971. The mall was originally built and opened in 1974 after the Boeing bust stalled construction in 1972. It was further plagued upon opening with one anchor store closing before opening as well as a low tenant rate."}}
