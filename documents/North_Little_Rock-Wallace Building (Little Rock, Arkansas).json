{"North_Little_Rock": {"Wallace Building (Little Rock, Arkansas)": "The Wallace Building is a nine-story commercial skyscraper at 101-11 Main Street in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. It was built in 1928 to a design by Little Rock architect George R. Mann, and is an excellent local example of early Art Deco architecture. It was built by George Washington Donaghey, a former Governor of Arkansas; Mann and Donaghey had previously worked together on the Arkansas State Capitol, with disputes over its construction propelling Donaghey into politics and the governor's seat."}}
