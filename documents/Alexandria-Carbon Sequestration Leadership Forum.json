{"Alexandria": {"Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum": "Carbon sequestration is the process involved in carbon capture and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide or other forms of carbon to mitigate or defer global warming. It has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases, which are released by burning fossil fuels.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, and physical processes."}}
