{"San_Leandro": {"Ridgemont, Oakland, California": "Ridgemont is one of Oakland's relatively newer affluent neighborhoods in the city's upscale hillside districts, this one located next to Merritt College along Campus Drive. First developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a tract-home development, albeit one tailored to affluent buyers, the neighborhood's stock of large tract homes has expanded to include exceptional custom estates and mansions perched on the neighborhood's choicest ridges, which offer expansive, uninterrupted views of the south San Francisco Bay. One of the last undeveloped hillside parcels in the city of Oakland, this district has in recent years added a new, less exclusive subdivision on the western slopes below Campus Drive."}}
