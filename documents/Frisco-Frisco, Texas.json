{"Frisco": {"Frisco, Texas": "Frisco is a city in Collin and Denton counties in Texas. It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and is approximately 25 miles (40 km) from both Dallas Love Field and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\nThe city population was 116,989 at the 2010 census. As of February 1, 2018, the city had an estimated population of 173,489. Frisco was the fastest-growing city in the United States in 2009, and also the fastest-growing city in the nation from 2000 to 2009. In the late 1990s, the northern Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex suburban development tide hit the northern border of Plano and spilled into Frisco, sparking explosive growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in the northern suburbs of Dallas, Frisco serves as a bedroom community for many professionals who work in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex.\nSince 2003, Frisco has received the designation \"Tree City USA\" by the National Arbor Day Foundation.\nSince the 2011 NCAA FCS Football Championship game, Frisco has unofficially adopted the nickname \"Fargo South\" for the end of December and first week of January, during the five-year reign of the North Dakota State University Bison football team (who are based out of Fargo, ND.) The Bison (pronounced \"Bizon\" by the huge fan base) made 5 straight trips to Frisco (2011 - 2015), bringing record numbers of fans with them, most of who are from Fargo. The Bison won all five appearances; and although did not return for the 2016 season, again made a return trip to Frisco for the 2017 Championship Game, which sold out Toyota Stadium against rival James Madison University.\n\n"}}
