{"Waterloo": {"Cedar Falls Independent Order of Odd Fellows Temple": "The Cedar Falls Independent Order of Odd Fellows Temple, in Cedar Falls, Iowa, also known as Odd Fellows Temple or 4th and Main Building, is an Independent Order of Odd Fellows building that was built during 1901-02. It is a three-and-a-half story building on a 46 feet (14 m) by 132 feet (40 m) base.\nIts 1996 nomination to the National Register of Historic Places asserted that it is historically significant because it attests to the important role of Odd Fellows in local social history, including providing life insurance to members' widows and orphans; because of it providing an example of a fraternal-commercial building, new at time of its construction; because it demonstrates the \"considerable skills\" of James E. Robinson, general contractor; and as it \"calls attention to the influence of late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century revival styling on its design.\"\nThe building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997."}}
