{"Redmond": {"Gontmakher Mansion": "The Gontmakher Mansion is a multimillion-dollar, 13,610-square-foot (1,264 m2) brick mansion in the Bridle Trails neighborhood of Bellevue, Washington. As of late 2005, it had been under construction for five years and was still unoccupied. Its brick construction and the tall brick wall completely surrounding the property give it a fortresslike appearance (brick is a material not frequently used in the Pacific Northwest)."}}
