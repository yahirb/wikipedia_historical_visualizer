{"Newton": {"Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries": "The Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries are a group of 42 [2] Jewish cemeteries in use since the 1920s on Baker Street in the West Roxbury section of Boston. The cemeteries are located on land that once formed part of Brook Farm, a 19th-century communal-living experiment.\nThe series of small cemeteries are strung along both sides of a narrow access road at 776 Baker Street [3] that leads only to the last of the small cemeteries."}}
