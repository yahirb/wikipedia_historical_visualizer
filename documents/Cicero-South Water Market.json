{"Cicero": {"South Water Market": "South Water Market is a historic produce market in the Near West Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Completed in 1925, the complex was designed as a structured replacement to Chicago's sprawling downtown produce markets on South Water Street; while these markets had existed since the mid-19th century, they had become a traffic and sanitation problem. The new complex included six buildings with 166 units, all with modernized and hygienic facilities; despite being relocated away from South Water Street, it kept the South Water name."}}
