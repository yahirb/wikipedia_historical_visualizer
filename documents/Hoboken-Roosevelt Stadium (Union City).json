{"Hoboken": {"Roosevelt Stadium (Union City)": "Roosevelt Stadium is a former American outdoor sports facility located in Union City, New Jersey. The stadium was built in 1936 and demolished in 2005 so Union City High School could be built on the site. After the school was built, its athletic complex was also named Roosevelt Stadium; the current field is located atop the school."}}
