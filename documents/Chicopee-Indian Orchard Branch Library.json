{"Chicopee": {"Indian Orchard Branch Library": "The Indian Orchard Branch Library is a historic branch library at 44 Oak Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Classic Revival building was constructed in 1909 to a design by John Donohue, an architect who normally worked in ecclesiastical buildings. It was the first permanent branch library building in the Springfield public library system; it was funded in part by a grant from Andrew Carnegie."}}
