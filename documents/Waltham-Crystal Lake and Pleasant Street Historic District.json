{"Waltham": {"Crystal Lake and Pleasant Street Historic District": "The Crystal Lake and Pleasant Street Historic District encompasses a streetcar suburban residential subdivision developed between 1860 and 1895 in Newton, Massachusetts. The district roughly bounded by the Sudbury Aqueduct, Pleasant Avenue, Lake Avenue, and Crystal Street and Webster Court. The subdivision was laid out in the 1850s after the Boston and Charles Railroad line (now serving the MBTA Green Line \"D\" Branch) was extended through Newton from Brookline."}}
