{"Sammamish": {"Overlake, Washington": "Overlake is the name for a region comprising parts of eastern Bellevue and southern Redmond, Washington, in the vicinity of Microsoft's main corporate campus. It is officially defined as a neighborhood consisting of the parts of Redmond lying south of Northeast 60th Street and between 148th Avenue Northeast and Bellevue-Redmond Road. The Overlake area, so named because it is located across Lake Washington from Seattle, straddles the boundaries of Bellevue and Redmond and is considered to have its own identity distinct from those of both cities."}}
