{"Huntington_Park": {"2nd Street Tunnel": "The 2nd Street Tunnel is a widely filmed and photographed tunnel on 2nd Street under Bunker Hill in Downtown Los Angeles, California. The Los Angeles Times described it as \"the most recognizable city landmark most Americans have never heard of\". It is 1,500 feet long, and lined with glossy white-glazed tiles that act similarly to a photographic light box, and, alteratively, to provided visually interesting, distorted, reflections of devices placed in it."}}
