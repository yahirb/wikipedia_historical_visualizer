{"Dearborn": {"Ambassador Bridge": "The Ambassador Bridge (French: Pont Ambassadeur) is a suspension bridge that connects Detroit, Michigan, United States, with Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It is the busiest international border crossing in North America in terms of trade volume: more than 25% of all merchandise trade between the United States and Canada crosses the toll bridge. A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the region and US$13 billion in annual production depend on the Detroit\u2013Windsor international border crossing."}}
