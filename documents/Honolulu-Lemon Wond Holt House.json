{"Honolulu": {"Lemon Wond Holt House": "The Lemon Wond Holt House at 3704 Anuhea Street in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi, belonged to Lemon Wond Holt, nicknamed \u201cRusty\u201d (22 September 1904 \u2013 12 March 1999), one of the last surviving local-born members of the \u201cStonewall Gang\u201d who frequented Waikiki Beach during the early 1900s.\nArchitecturally, the house is significant as one of the first examples of a \"modestly detailed, fantasy picturesque style residence\" built in Hawai\u02bbi during the late 1920s and early 1930s. It is entirely typical for that period\u2014in its materials, methods, craftsmanship, and design\u2014and is one of only a dozen or so such homes that still survive in Honolulu."}}
