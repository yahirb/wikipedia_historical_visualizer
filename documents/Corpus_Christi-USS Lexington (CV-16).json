{"Corpus_Christi": {"USS Lexington (CV-16)": "USS Lexington (CV/CVA/CVS/CVT/AVT-16), nicknamed \"The Blue Ghost\", is an Essex-class aircraft carrier built during World War II for the United States Navy. Originally intended to be named Cabot, word arrived during construction that USS Lexington (CV-2) had been lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea. The new aircraft carrier was renamed while under construction to commemorate the earlier ship."}}
