{"Worcester": {"Aldus Chapin Higgins House": "The Aldus Chapin Higgins House is an historic house at 1 John Wing Road, on the campus of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), in Worcester, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story house was designed by Grosvenor Atterbury, although Aldus Chapin Higgins, the owner, had likely made sketches and other design notes for some years before hiring Atterbury. The house, whose exterior is faced in stucco, brick, and stone, is in the Tudor Revival style, and contains antique building materials imported from Europe."}}
