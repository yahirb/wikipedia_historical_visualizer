{"Duluth": {"Munger Terrace": "Munger Terrace is a landmarked apartment block in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. It was originally eight luxury townhouses.\nThe building, in brick with brownstone trim, was constructed in 1891-92 for Roger S. Munger, an important early Duluth entrepreneur, on a site next to his Victorian Gothic mansion; the houses were rentals, Munger's only such project."}}
