{"Portsmouth": {"Jordan Bridge": "The Jordan Bridge, officially named the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge, is a tolled highway fixed bridge which carries State Route 337 over the Southern Branch Elizabeth River from the City of Portsmouth into the City of Chesapeake in South Hampton Roads, Virginia. The new crossing is an all-electronic toll facility that eliminated bridge lifts and height and weight restrictions and restored a vital river crossing for the Hampton Roads region.\nOriginally opened in 1928, it was privately built by an organization led by South Norfolk businessmen Wallace and Carl Jordan."}}
