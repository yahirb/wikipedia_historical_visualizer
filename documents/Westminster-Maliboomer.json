{"Westminster": {"Maliboomer": "The Maliboomer was an attraction at the Paradise Pier section of Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Manufactured by S&S Power, Mailboomer was a Space Shot attraction, meaning it launched guests from the bottom of the tower instead of slowly lifting them to the top and dropping them from there. The ride was pneumatically powered, with three connected towers, each with its own independent ride system."}}
