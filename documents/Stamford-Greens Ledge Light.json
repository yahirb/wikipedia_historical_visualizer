{"Stamford": {"Greens Ledge Light": "Greens Ledge Lighthouse is a sparkplug lighthouse in Connecticut, United States, off the southwest end of the Norwalk Islands, Long Island Sound, near Norwalk, Connecticut. It is on north side of the west end of Greens Ledge, west of Norwalk Harbor a mile south of the entrance to Five Mile River at Rowayton, and just over a mile southwest of Sheffield Lighthouse. Completed in 1902, it was constructed by the Philadelphia Construction Company. The light is 52 feet (16 m) tall and is made of five courses that make up its four stories. The lantern measures 7 feet (2.1 m) in diameter. The Greens Ledge Light replaced the Sheffield Island Light. Originally, the light had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed in May 1902, just three months into its operation. Currently a VRB-25 is in use and it has alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Greens Ledge Lighthouse on May 29, 1990.\nIn 2017, a restoration campaign, 'Save Greens Ledge' was launched to preserve and protect Greens Ledge Light. Greens Ledge was acquired by the Greens Ledge Light Preservation Society, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization established on September 30, 2016 by a group of local residents including Brendan McGee, Tim Pettee, Shannon Holloway, and Alex Pettee. The acquisition was made through a founding donation by The Pettee Family. Tim Pettee serves as the group's President."}}
