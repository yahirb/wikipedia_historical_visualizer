{"Winston-Salem": {"Smith Reynolds Airport": "Smith Reynolds Airport (IATA: INT, ICAO: KINT, FAA LID: INT) is a public airport located 3 miles (5 km) northeast of the city of Winston-Salem in Forsyth County, North Carolina, USA. The airport has two runways, and is used primarily for general aviation and flight training as there is no scheduled passenger airline service at the present time. In addition, it is home to the Winston-Salem air show, which is usually held in September, and draws about 20,000 spectators.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe question of an airmail route and an airport for Winston-Salem was decided in the 1920s when land west of Greensboro was selected over a Winston-Salem tract, and Winston-Salem withdrew from the Tri-city Airport Commission."}}
