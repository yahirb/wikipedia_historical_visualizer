{"Atlanta": {"Loew's Grand Theatre": "Loew's Grand Theater, originally DeGive's Grand Opera House, was a movie theater at the corner of Peachtree and Forsyth Streets in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, in the United States. It was most famous as the site of the 1939 premiere of Gone with the Wind, which was attended by the stars of the film, except for the African Americans who appeared in it, who were also excluded from the souvenir program. (They were to be segregated and be in the \"colored-only\" regions if they were to be present in the theaters at all.)\nIt concentrated on showing films made or released by MGM, a Loews-owned studio, even boasting a sign under its marquee proclaiming it \"The Home of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures\"."}}
