{"Loveland": {"Harold Ferguson High School": "Ferguson High School was originally known as the Washington Alternative High School from 1972 to 1981. In 1982, FHS was moved to its second location at 804 East Eisenhower; it was there until January 2009 when it was moved into its current location at 1101 Hilltop Drive (formally Immanuel Lutheran Church and School). This makes FHS one of the oldest alternative, at-risk programs in the state of Colorado."}}
