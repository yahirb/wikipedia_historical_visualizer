{"Cleveland": {"Landmark Office Towers Complex": "The Landmark Office Towers is a complex of three historically renovated 1930-completed 259 foot 22 story high-rises that are located on the property of Tower City Center in Downtown Cleveland's Public Square district. The building features very deep recesses on its south side. Actually, the building is three towers in one. These are the Midland Bank Building, the Medical Arts Building, and the Builders Exchange Building. The complex was to include a forth tower that was never completed and so there is still an empty space where that tower was to go to the present day."}}
