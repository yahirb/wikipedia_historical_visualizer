{"Atlanta": {"WABE": "WABE FM 90.1 is a radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, that is affiliated with National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Radio International (PRI). WABE's format features mostly classical music, although the station will occasionally play a Beatles tune, a Broadway show tune, a film suite, or a selection from a film such as Star Wars, as long as the piece is in a classical-sounding arrangement. WABE-FM has lately added the short feature Atlanta Sounds (broadcast several times a day) and twice weekly previews of weekend events around the city."}}
