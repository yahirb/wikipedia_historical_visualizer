{"Chicopee": {"Hibernian Block": "The Hibernian Block was a historic commercial building at 345-349 Worthington Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. It was built in 1910 for the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic fraternal organization. The building had a distinctive Classical Revival styling, using brick piers instead of columns between its large glass windows."}}
