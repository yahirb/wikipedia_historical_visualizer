Bowden Golf Course, is a golf course located in Macon, Georgia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe course was designed in 1938 by John C. Cotton, a Macon professional golfer, and built by labor supplied by the Works Progress Administration on the site of a former airfield in east Macon, known as Miller Field. Most of the growth in golf courses between 1933 and 1942 came from New Deal initiatives, changing the face of golf in the United States."}}
