{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"Louisville Water Tower": "The Louisville Water Tower, located east of downtown Louisville, Kentucky near the riverfront, is the oldest ornamental water tower in the world, having been built before the more famous Chicago Water Tower. Both the actual water tower and its pumping station are on the National Register of Historic Places. As with the Fairmount Water Works of Philadelphia (designed 1812, built 1819\u201322), the industrial nature of its pumping station was disguised in the form of a Greek temple complex."}}
