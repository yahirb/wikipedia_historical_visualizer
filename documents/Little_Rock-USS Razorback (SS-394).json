{"Little_Rock": {"USS Razorback (SS-394)": "USS Razorback (SS-394), a Balao-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named after the razorback, a species of whale (Balaenoptera physalus) found in the far southern reaches of the Pacific Ocean. It is arguably the longest-serving submarine still existing in the world, having been commissioned by two different countries for 57 years of active duty. In 2004, the state of Arkansas adopted the submarine (although it was not named after the University of Arkansas mascot) and is now a museum ship at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum."}}
