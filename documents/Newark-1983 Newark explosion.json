{"Newark": {"1983 Newark explosion": "\n== Summary ==\nOn Saturday, January 8, 1983, at approximately 12:15 am, the city of Newark, New Jersey experienced an explosion due to a human error at the Texaco Farms fuel storage facilities. After an intense investigation, the Newark Fire Department came to the conclusion that there was no foul play; however, they also concluded that an accidental ''spillage or overfilling'' caused the midnight explosion of three gasoline storage tanks at a Texaco facility. Further investigation by the company indicated that workers had failed to monitor a pipeline delivery of gasoline to a tank, violating Texaco operations manuals that called for checks of the gauge."}}
