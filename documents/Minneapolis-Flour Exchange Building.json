{"Minneapolis": {"Flour Exchange Building": "The Flour Exchange Building is an office building in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, designed by architects Long and Kees, who also designed Minneapolis City Hall and the Lumber Exchange Building. Construction originally began in 1892, but halted abruptly in 1893 after only four floors had been built. This was due to the effects of the Panic of 1893."}}
