{"Stamford": {"Cove Island Houses": "The Cove Island Houses, although plural in name, is a single house in Cove Island Park, in Stamford, Connecticut. The house was expanded from a first section that dates from 1791, and is now predominantly a Georgian style house with an older Federal style wing. It is the only building that is a legacy of the large Stamford Mills complex at the Cove. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It presently houses administrative offices of Cove Island Park."}}
