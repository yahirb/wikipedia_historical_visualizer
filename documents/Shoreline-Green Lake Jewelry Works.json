{"Shoreline": {"Green Lake Jewelry Works": "Green Lake Jewelry Works is a Seattle jewelry designer, manufacturer, and retailer. Selling mostly custom made jewelry, the company is known for a customer experience of personalized contact with traditional artisans that is profitably scaled up to a relatively large business operation, made possible by its use of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), in combination with effective use of e-commerce technology. They maintain a relatively small physical inventory that is augmented by a \"virtual inventory\" of renderings of their offerings."}}
