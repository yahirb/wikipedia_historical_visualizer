{"Worcester": {"Whittall Mills": "The Whittall Mills is an historic industrial complex off Brussels Street in southern Worcester, Massachusetts. The complex, which was built between 1870 and 1930, is a reminder of the large carpet manufacturing business that was once a major presence in the city. It is a complex of 15 brick buildings located on a bend of the Middle River (a tributary of the Blackstone River), south of Crompton Street and just west of Interstate 290."}}
