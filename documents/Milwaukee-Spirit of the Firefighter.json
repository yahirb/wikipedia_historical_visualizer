{"Milwaukee": {"Spirit of the Firefighter": "Spirit of the Firefighter is a public art work by American artist Mark Jeffries, located on the north side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The bronze sculpture depicts a male figure wearing a firefighter's protective uniform: cuffed boots with trousers tucked inside, a long belted coat with toggle closures on the front, and a close-fitting hood. On top of his head is a brinned hat with an \"Engine 37 MFD\" badge on the front."}}
