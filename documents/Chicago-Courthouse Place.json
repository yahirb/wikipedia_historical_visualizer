{"Chicago": {"Courthouse Place": "Courthouse Place, also known as the Cook County Criminal Court Building, is a Richardsonian Romanesque-style building at 54 West Hubbard Street in the Near North Side of Chicago. Designed by architect Otto H. Matz and completed in 1893, it replaced and reused material from the earlier 1874 criminal courthouse (the same location of the trial and hangings related to the Haymarket Affair). The complex included the Cook County Jail and the hanging gallows for prisoners sentenced to death."}}
