{"New_Brunswick": {"Albus Cavus": "Albus Cavus is a collective of artists and educators who transform public spaces with creativity. Originally, it was established as an underground art gallery and presentation space in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States. Albus Cavus, which means \"white cave\" in Latin, was originally started in September 2002 as a small basement exhibit space that gradually grew into a large artist collective that spans far beyond New Jersey."}}
