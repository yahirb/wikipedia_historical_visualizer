{"Los_Angeles": {"Historic Broadway station": "Historic Broadway is an under-construction light rail subway station in the Los Angeles County Metro Rail system. The station is located near the intersection of 2nd Street and Broadway in the Historic Core section of Downtown Los Angeles. In planning documents, the station was originally named 2nd St/Broadway.\nThe station is directly across the street from the main offices of the Los Angeles Times, and is a block from the historic Broadway Theater District.\nHistoric Broadway is part of the Regional Connector project, a tunnel through Downtown Los Angeles that will connect the current Metro Rail Blue, Expo, and Gold Lines. Under current plans, the station will be served by both the restructured Blue Line, connecting Long Beach and the San Gabriel Valley, and the restructured Gold Line, connecting Santa Monica and East Los Angeles. The Regional Connector is scheduled to open in 2021."}}
