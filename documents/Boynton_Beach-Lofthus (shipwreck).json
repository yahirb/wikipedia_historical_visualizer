{"Boynton_Beach": {"Lofthus (shipwreck)": "The Lofthus (also known as the Cashmere) is a Norwegian shipwreck (which sank in 1898) near Boynton Beach, Florida, United States. Built in 1868 in Sunderland, England, the iron-hulled vessel was originally christened Cashmere and rigged as a three masted barque. After a career in the East Indian trade Cashmere was sold to a Norwegian firm, renamed Lofthus, and used in the American trade."}}
