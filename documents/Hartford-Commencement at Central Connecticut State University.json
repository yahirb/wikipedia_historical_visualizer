{"Hartford": {"Commencement at Central Connecticut State University": "Central Connecticut State University's annual undergraduate commencement exercises are held each May at the XL Center in Hartford. At present, this is the only occasion upon which bachelor's degrees are conferred by the university. Since 1989, a separate graduation ceremony has been held for recipients of postgraduate degrees."}}
