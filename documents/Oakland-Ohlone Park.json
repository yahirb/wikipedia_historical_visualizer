{"Oakland": {"Ohlone Park": "The Ohlone, named Costanoan by early Spanish colonists (the Spanish word costa means \"coast\"), are a Native American people of the Northern California coast. When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas Valley. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages."}}
