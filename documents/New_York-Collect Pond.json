{"New_York": {"Collect Pond": "The Collect Pond, or Fresh Water Pond, was a body of fresh water in what is now Chinatown, Lower Manhattan in New York City. For the first two centuries of European settlement in Manhattan, it was the main water supply for the growing city. The former pond became the site of a jail and is now a city park, Collect Pond Park, which includes a pond evocative of its former status.\n\n"}}
