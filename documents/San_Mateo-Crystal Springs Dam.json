{"San_Mateo": {"Crystal Springs Dam": "Crystal Springs Dam is a gravity dam constructed across the San Mateo Creek, impounding water to form the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir in San Mateo County, California. It was among the first concrete gravity dams built in the western United States.\nThe structure was completed in 1888, and has survived both the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake \u2014 despite its location directly on the San Andreas Fault."}}
