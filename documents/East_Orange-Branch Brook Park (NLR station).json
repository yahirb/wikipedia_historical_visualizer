{"East_Orange": {"Branch Brook Park (NLR station)": "Branch Brook Park Station is a station located at Anthony Place (formerly North Fifth Street) north of Heller Parkway on the Newark City Subway Line of the Newark Light Rail. This station was opened in 2001 to replace a previous streetcar loop at this stop, then called Franklin Avenue Station to allow for longer vehicles to be used that replaced the PCC streetcars that previously ran the line, and also replaced the now-shuttered Heller Parkway Station. The station was named for Branch Brook Park and is the northernmost Newark Light Rail station along the west side of the park."}}
