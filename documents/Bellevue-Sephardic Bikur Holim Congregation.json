{"Bellevue": {"Sephardic Bikur Holim Congregation": "Sephardic Bikur Holim Congregation (SBH) is a Sephardic congregation with a synagogue in the Seward Park neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The name Bikur Holim (which can be transliterated various ways into English) means visiting or comforting the sick, an important mitzvah. The first official name of the congregation was Spanish Hebrew Society and Congregation Bikur Holim, shortened to \"Sephardic Bikur Holim\" (\"Sephardic\" to avoid confusion with Seattle's similarly named Ashkenazic congregation)."}}
