{"Union_City": {"Short Hills Park Historic District": "The Short Hills Park historic district is the oldest area of that unincorporated community in Millburn, Essex County, New Jersey, United States. It consists of roughly a thousand acres (4 km\u00b2) with 125 buildings, mostly homes, in the area developed earliest by Stewart Hartshorn, whose goal was to create an \"ideal town\" for living close to nature and the countryside on the 1,550 acres (6.3 km2) he bought in the area in 1877. Many of the streets follow natural contours, and Hartshorn routed them to leave as many trees standing as possible."}}
