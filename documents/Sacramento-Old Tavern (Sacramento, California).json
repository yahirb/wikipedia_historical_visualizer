{"Sacramento": {"Old Tavern (Sacramento, California)": "The Old Tavern (also known as the Sacramento Brewery) is a historic building listed on the National Register of Historic Places located in Sacramento, California.\nThe first structure on the site of the Old Tavern, likely used for storage, was built by John Sutter after he constructed Sutter's Fort across the street. This edifice was expanded in the early 1850s when a Philip Scheld turned it into a two-story building and founded Scheld's Sacramento Brewery."}}
