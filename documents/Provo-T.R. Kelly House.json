{"Provo": {"T.R. Kelly House": "The T.R. Kelly House at 164 W. 200 South in Springville, Utah, United States, was built in 1903. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\nAccording to architectural historian Deborah R. Temme, writing the NRHP nomination:\n\nThe Kelly House, because on the one hand it reflects the popular trend of the time, the use of books for house designs, and on the other hand, because it is a unique type among the types that were built and repeated, reflects the owner's desire to be up to date according to the method of design, but also expresses his concurrent wish to have a house that would stand apart from others and express his own individuality."}}
