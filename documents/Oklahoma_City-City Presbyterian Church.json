{"Oklahoma_City": {"City Presbyterian Church": "City Presbyterian Church (originally Park Congregational Church and later Pilgrim Congregational Church) is the name of a church located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. The current congregation has no direct connection to the one which originally occupied the building. The building sits on a lot bound by 13th Street and Classen Drive, and therefore has two different street addresses."}}
