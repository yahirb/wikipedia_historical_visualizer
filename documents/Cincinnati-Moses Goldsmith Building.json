{"Cincinnati": {"Moses Goldsmith Building": "The Moses Goldsmith Building is a historic residence in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built in 1900, it was originally owned by Moses Goldsmith, the president of a firm that sold notions; rather than living in the house, Goldsmith built it for investment purposes, renting it to others.\nA brick house with elements of sandstone and limestone, the Goldsmith Building has been ranked as a fine example of Renaissance Revival architecture."}}
