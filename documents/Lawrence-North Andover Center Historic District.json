{"Lawrence": {"North Andover Center Historic District": "The North Andover Center Historic District encompasses the historic center of North Andover, Massachusetts, which was also the heart of neighboring Andover until the two towns split in 1855. The district is roughly bounded by Osgood, Pleasant, Stevens, Johnson, and Andover Streets and Wood Lane. It includes 75 properties, including two that were previously listed: the Parson Barnard House, and the Kittredge Mansion, the latter of which is built on land that included the town's original muster ground."}}
