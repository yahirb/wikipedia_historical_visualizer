{"Richmond": {"Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond": "Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond (ICA), also known as the Markel Center at the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art, is an arts center at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA, proposed for completion in 2017. It will be built by Steven Holl and Associates, selected from 64 competing architectural firms worldwide, along with local architect, BCWH Architects. Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao, in announcing plans for the ICA in 2011, said that the prominence of the museum's location, \"bordering the city's Arts District and in the Broad Street Corridor  which links the VCU Monroe Park Campus with VCU's Medical Center\" would have symbolic significance."}}
