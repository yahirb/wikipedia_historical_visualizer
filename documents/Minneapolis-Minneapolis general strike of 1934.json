{"Minneapolis": {"Minneapolis general strike of 1934": "The Minneapolis general strike of 1934 grew out of a strike by Teamsters against most of the trucking companies operating in Minneapolis, the major distribution center for the Upper Midwest. The strike began on May 16, 1934 in the Market District (the modern day Warehouse District). The worst single day was Friday, July 20, called \"Bloody Friday\", when police shot at strikers in a downtown truck battle, killing two and injuring 67."}}
