{"Folsom": {"Carpenter Hill": "Carpenter Hill is a hill located in the eastern Sacramento Valley-Sierra Nevada foothills region of California. The hill, located within the city limits of Folsom, near the Sacramento-El Dorado county line and north of U.S. Route 50, rises to an elevation of 828 feet (252 m). Despite its low elevation, the hill is the county highpoint of Sacramento County and thus the summit offers expansive views of the Central Valley."}}
