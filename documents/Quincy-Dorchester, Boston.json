{"Quincy": {"Dorchester, Boston": "Dorchester is a historic neighborhood comprising more than 6 square miles (16 km2) in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Originally, Dorchester was a separate town, founded by Puritans who emigrated in 1630 from Dorchester, Dorset, England. This dissolved municipality, Boston's largest neighborhood by far, is often divided by city planners in order to create two planning areas roughly equivalent in size and population to other Boston neighborhoods."}}
