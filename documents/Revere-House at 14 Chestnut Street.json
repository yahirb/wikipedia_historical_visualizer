{"Revere": {"House at 14 Chestnut Street": "The House at 14 Chestnut Street in Somerville, Massachusetts was one of the last residential structures in the Brickbottom area of the city. Built about 1860, it was a two-story wood frame structure with Italianate style, with bracketed eaves and an elaborately decorated front door hood. The area where it stood was once lined with similar modestly-scaled worker housing, most of which was demolished to turn the area into an industrial park."}}
