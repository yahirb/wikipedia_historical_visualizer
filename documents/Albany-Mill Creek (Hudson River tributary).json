{"Albany": {"Mill Creek (Hudson River tributary)": "Mill Creek, also previously known as Tierken Kill, is a tributary to the Hudson River. Poetanock was the Native American name for the stream. From its source just west of Snyders Lake in East Greenbush the stream travels southwest, then north and west to the Hudson River."}}
