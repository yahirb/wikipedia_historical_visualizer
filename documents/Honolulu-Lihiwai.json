{"Honolulu": {"Lihiwai": "Lihiwai was the residence of Territorial Governor George R. Carter in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was designed by the architects Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and Hardie Phillip, built in 1927-29, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and its boundaries increased in 1987. Goodhue came to Honolulu from New York City to design not just this home, but also the Honolulu Museum of Art on the site of the former home of Anna Rice Cooke."}}
