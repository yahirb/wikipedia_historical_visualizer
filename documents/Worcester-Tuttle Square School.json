{"Worcester": {"Tuttle Square School": "The Tuttle Square School, now the Auburn Historical Museum, is an historic school building at 41 South Street in Auburn, Massachusetts. The single story two-room wood frame building was constructed in 1922 to replace a smaller school on the site, in the face of increasing school population. The building's most prominent decorative feature is its Federal-style entry door surround, with pilasters supporting scrolled brackets, topped by a fanlight."}}
