{"Waltham": {"Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center": "The Walter E. Fernald State School, later the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center (aka Fernald Developmental Center or simply Fernald), was the Western hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving people with developmental disabilities. Originally a Victorian sanatorium, it became a \"poster child\" for the American eugenics movement during the 1920s. It later was the scene of medical experiments in the 20th century."}}
