{"South_Bend": {"Ballpark Synagogue": "B'nai Israel Synagogue (Sons of Israel Synagogue) is an historic synagogue in South Bend, Indiana. The oldest synagogue in South Bend, it is also thought to be \"America's only ballpark synagogue.\" In 2012 the unused synagogue was renovated and reopened as a gift shop for the South Bend Cubs minor league baseball team, whose ballpark abuts the property. The synagogue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013."}}
