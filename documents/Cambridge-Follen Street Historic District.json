{"Cambridge": {"Follen Street Historic District": "The Follen Street Historic District is a historic district in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just northwest of the Cambridge Common. Follen Street is a quiet residential street, isolated from through streets by large masonry buildings that front on Waterford Street and Garden Street. All but three of the houses on the street were built no later than 1900, and show a remarkable quality of workmanship, despite being diverse in their styles."}}
