{"West_Valley_City": {"Hoberman Arch": "The Hoberman Arch was the centerpiece of the Olympic Medals Plaza in downtown Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Following the Olympics the arch was moved to the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park where, along with the Olympic cauldron, it was one of the main highlights and an important part of Salt Lake's Olympic legacy. In August 2014 the arch was removed from the park and a new public display location is currently being planned."}}
