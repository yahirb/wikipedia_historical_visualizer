{"San_Mateo": {"Japan Airlines Flight 2": "Japan Airlines Flight 2 was a flight piloted by Captain Kohei Asoh on November 22, 1968. The plane was a new Douglas DC-8 named \"Shiga\", flying from Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) to San Francisco International Airport. Due to heavy fog and other factors, Asoh mistakenly landed the plane near Coyote Point in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, two and a half miles short of the runway."}}
