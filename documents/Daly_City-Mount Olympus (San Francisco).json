{"Daly_City": {"Mount Olympus (San Francisco)": "Mount Olympus is a hill located on Upper Terrace in the Ashbury Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. It was once considered to mark the geographical center of the city, and was topped off by a statue given by Adolph Sutro, the Triumph of Light, now lost. Only the statue's pedestal remains, and the view from the top is obstructed by trees and condominiums."}}
