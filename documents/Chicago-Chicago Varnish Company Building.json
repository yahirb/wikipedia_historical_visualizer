{"Chicago": {"Chicago Varnish Company Building": "The Chicago Varnish Company Building, at 33 West Kinzie Street, was built in 1895 as the headquarters of one of the leading varnish manufacturers in the United States, the Chicago Varnish Company. The building is a rare example of Dutch Renaissance Revival-style architecture in Chicago, and is marked by a steeply pitched roof paired with stepped gables of red brick and light stone in contrasting colors. The building was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, a nationally recognized architect whose other significant works include the former Chicago Historical Society Building, the Newberry Library, and the original buildings for the University of Chicago campus."}}
