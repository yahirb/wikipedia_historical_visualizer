{"Baltimore": {"Copycat Building": "The 1501 Guilford Ave building (most commonly known as the Copycat Building) was built in 1897 as a manufacturing warehouse. Today it has become home to the creative class of Baltimore, Maryland and continues to be a creative landmark of the Station North Arts and Entertainment District.\nIn order to save manufacturing companies inside the building from moving out, Charles Lankford bought the Copycat Building in 1983 from a previous owner for the sum of $225,000."}}
