{"Lynn": {"Bessie Monroe House": "The Bessie Monroe House is a historic house at 7 Ash Street in Salem, Massachusetts. It is notable as a good example of a Federal style house, and for its survival from planned demolition during Salem's urban renewal of the area in the 1970s. The house, a modest two story brick house located just north of Salem's downtown, was built in 1811 for Thomas Perkins, a local merchant whose brother was its first occupant."}}
