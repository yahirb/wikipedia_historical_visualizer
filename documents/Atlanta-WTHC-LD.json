{"Atlanta": {"WTHC-LD": "WTHC-LD is a low-power independent television station located on channel 42 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. From 1994 to 2007, it was owned and operated by The Atlanta Channel, Inc., which also broadcast the channel into many local hotels. Programming consists almost entirely of recorded information for tourists staying in downtown hotels, although the signal can usually be picked up as far away as Sandy Springs, about ten miles or 15 km away. The station is itself atop Atlanta's most well-known hotel, the Westin Peachtree Plaza, on a mast constructed for WVEU (now WUPA) TV 69, along with other stations."}}
