{"Haverhill": {"Ephraim Davis House": "The Ephraim Davis House is a historic First Period house on Merrimack Road, north of the junction with Amesbury Line Road in Haverhill, Massachusetts. It is now an outbuilding of a farm, functioning as a garage and storage space. The first part of the 2.5 story house was built in 1705 by Ephraim Davis, who married in that year."}}
