{"Bellevue": {"Allied Arts of Seattle": "Allied Arts of Seattle is a non-profit organization in Seattle, Washington, USA. The organization advocates for public funding of the arts, better urban planning and architecture, and other civic improvements. The organization claims to be the \"oldest non-profit organization in Seattle dedicated to urban livability\", but, in any case, at 50+ years old is certainly a venerable organization by the standards of a city barely older than 150 years It was a major force in establishing the Seattle Arts Commission, creating Seattle Center on the grounds of the Century 21 Exposition (1962 world's fair) and preserving historical landmarks and neighborhoods, particularly Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market, as well as defeating the 2012 Seattle Olympic bid.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nAllied Arts grew out of the Beer & Culture Society organized in early 1952 by University of Washington drama professor John Ashby Conway."}}
