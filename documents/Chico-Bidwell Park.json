{"Chico": {"Bidwell Park": "Bidwell Park is a municipal park located in Chico, California. The park was established July 10, 1905, through the donation by Annie Bidwell (widow of Chico's founder, John Bidwell) of approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2) of land to the City of Chico. Since that time, the City has purchased additional land, such as Cedar Grove in 1922, and 1,200 acres (5 km2) of land south of Big Chico Creek in upper Bidwell Park in 1995."}}
