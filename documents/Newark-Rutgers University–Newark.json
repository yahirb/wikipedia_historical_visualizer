{"Newark": {"Rutgers University\u2013Newark": "Rutgers\u2013Newark is one of three regional campuses of Rutgers University, the public research university of the U.S. state of New Jersey, located in the city of Newark. Rutgers, founded in 1766 in New Brunswick, is the eighth oldest college in the United States and a member of the Association of American Universities. In 1945, the state legislature voted to make Rutgers University, then a private liberal arts college, into the state university and the following year merged the school with the former University of Newark (1936\u20131946), which became the Rutgers\u2013Newark campus."}}
