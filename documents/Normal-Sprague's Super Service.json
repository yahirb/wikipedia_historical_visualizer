{"Normal": {"Sprague's Super Service": "Sprague's Super Service is a historic independent gas station on Route 66 in Normal, Illinois.\nA Tudor revival building constructed in 1931 by William Sprague to house a service station, restaurant and garage, it is the largest of three remaining two-story fuel station buildings on US 66, originally housing a caf\u00e9 and service station on the main floor plus two second-floor apartments for the owner and the station attendant.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs Pine Street (the main U.S. 66 route before construction of the Veterans Parkway as a bypass after 1940) is part of a largely-residential neighbourhood, the station was designed to fit with its surroundings by having the building follows the architectural conventions of a private residence."}}
