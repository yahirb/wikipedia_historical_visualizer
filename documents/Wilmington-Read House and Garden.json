{"Wilmington": {"Read House and Garden": "The Read House and Garden is a historic house museum at 42 The Strand in New Castle, Delaware. The house, built in 1793 for George Read, Jr., was the largest and most sophisticated residence in the state at the time, and is a significant early example of high-style Federal period architecture. The adjacent formal gardens were laid out in the late 1840s by William Couper, the house's third owner."}}
