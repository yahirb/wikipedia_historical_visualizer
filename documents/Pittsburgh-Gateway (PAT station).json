{"Pittsburgh": {"Gateway (PAT station)": "Gateway is a station on the Port Authority of Allegheny County's Pittsburgh Light Rail network, and until October 30, 2009 it was the \"T\" system's westernmost extent within downtown Pittsburgh. The Port Authority closed Gateway Center as part of construction work on the North Shore Connector project, and a new station opened in 2012 (though its name was truncated from \"Gateway Center\" to simply \"Gateway\"). The former station entrance was demolished and a new station was built."}}
