{"Cleveland": {"Buckeye-Shaker": "Buckeye-Shaker is a city planning area on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio. It encompasses two neighborhoods: in its south and west the old Buckeye neighborhood and in its northeast the Shaker Square neighborhood which is centered on an historic shopping district and an eponymous rapid transit station, located at the intersection of Shaker and Moreland Boulevards, on the light rail line that connects the city of Shaker Heights to downtown Cleveland. From the early to mid-20th century, the Buckeye Road neighborhood was known as Little Hungary, serving as the historic heart of Cleveland's Hungarian community, which at one time was the largest in the world outside of Hungary and for years has been almost completely African-American."}}
