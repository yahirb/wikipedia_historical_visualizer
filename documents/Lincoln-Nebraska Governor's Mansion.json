{"Lincoln": {"Nebraska Governor's Mansion": "The Nebraska Governor's Mansion is the official residence of the Governor of Nebraska and his family. Located in Lincoln, Nebraska, it is a modified Georgian Colonial home which began operation as the governor's residence on March 17, 1958. Governor Victor E. Anderson was the first to live here. The architect was Selmer Solheim & Associates. The residence has 31 rooms, including 5 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms, 4 fireplaces and a 3-stall garage. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.\nFormer Nebraska First Gentleman Bill Orr led efforts to refurbish the mansion during the late 1980s. Orr, who moved into the mansion with his wife, Governor Kay Orr, in 1987, had described the then interior decor as \"early Holiday Inn\" noting that \"We can do better.\" Bill Orr authored a cookbook, The First Gentleman's Cookbook, with all proceeds going to a $200,000 fund to renovate and refurbish the mansion. Orr published recipes submitted by Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan, Warren Buffett, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Tom Osborne, and Dick Cavett in his cookbook."}}
