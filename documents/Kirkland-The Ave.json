{"Kirkland": {"The Ave": "Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola (AVE) is a service of high-speed rail in Spain operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, at speeds of up to 310 km/h (193 mph). Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola translates to \"Spanish High Speed\", but the initials are also a play on the word ave, meaning \"bird\". As of August 2017, the Spanish AVE system is the longest HSR network in Europe with 3,240 km (2,010 mi) and the second longest in the world, after China's."}}
