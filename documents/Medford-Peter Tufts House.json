{"Medford": {"Peter Tufts House": "The Peter Tufts House (formerly and incorrectly known as the Cradock House) is a Colonial American house located at 350 Riverside Avenue (formerly known as Ship Street) in Medford, Massachusetts. It is currently thought to have been built between 1677\u20131678. Past historians considered it to be the oldest brick house in the United States, although that distinction belongs to Bacon's Castle, the 1665 plantation home of Virginian Arthur Allen."}}
