{"Waukesha": {"Deacon West Octagon House": "The Deacon West Octagon House, built in 1856 (1854) by Deacon Josiah West, is an historic eleven-room octagonal house located at 370 High Street, in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The wooden sign posted in front of the house states, \"Josiah West 1854 Octagon House.\" It is only one of 19 such structures in the state. West sold the house to Ira Rowe in 1866, and in 1870 it was partially destroyed by fire, but its strong 18-inch-thick (460 mm) cement walls remained standing."}}
