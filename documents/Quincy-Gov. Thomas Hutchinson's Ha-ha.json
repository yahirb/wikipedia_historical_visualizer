{"Quincy": {"Gov. Thomas Hutchinson's Ha-ha": "Gov. Thomas Hutchinson's Ha-ha is a historic ha-ha at 100-122 Randolph Avenue in Milton, Massachusetts.\nThe ha-ha (a sunken wall which permits unblocked views, while still serving functions of a wall such as delineating a border and preventing livestock from crossing) was constructed by then-Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson in the early 1700s, when the land was part of his extensive Milton estate."}}
