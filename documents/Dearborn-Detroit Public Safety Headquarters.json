{"Dearborn": {"Detroit Public Safety Headquarters": "The Detroit Public Safety Headquarters located at 1301 Third Street in Detroit, Michigan is a law enforcement and fire department complex which houses the headquarters for the Detroit Police Department, Detroit Fire Department, Detroit Emergency Medical Service as well as a forensics laboratory for the Michigan State Police. After the City of Detroit acquired the building its physical address was re-designated from John C. Lodge Freeway to its present address on Third Street and Michigan Avenue to disassociate itself from the building's prior occupants, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service who were the original owners and the MGM Grand Detroit Casino who purchased the building from the IRS.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of consolidating Detroit's public safety was not a new idea, and in fact had been discussed extensively as far back as Mayor Dennis Archer's administration but it wasn't until recent years that the city began to realize that 1300 Beaubien, where the Detroit Police had been headquartered since 1923, was beginning to show signs of aging and serious structural problems as well as an infestation of rodents and insects throughout the building. The City's Fire Department on West Larned was in better condition than the police headquarters, but was starting to lack sufficient space to house the department's offices and communications center."}}
