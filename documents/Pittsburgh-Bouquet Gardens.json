{"Pittsburgh": {"Bouquet Gardens": "Bouquet Gardens is a major student residential complex of the University of Pittsburgh consisting of eight, 4-story garden-style gabled-roofed apartment buildings (Buildings A through H) clustered around progression of courtyards connected by an interior pathway as well as a four-story apartment-style residence hall (Building J). Each gabled-roofed apartment-style building contains sixteen 4-bedroom apartments while the 155 bed Building J contains amenities for use by residents of the entire complex.[1] Designed by Renaissance 3 Architects, P.C.[2], the combined complex houses 651 upper-level undergraduate students in 172 units located on the lower campus close to Posvar Hall, the Barco Law Building, and adjacent to Sennott Square.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bouquet Gardens complex sits on a property bounded by Oakland Avenue, South Bouquet and Sennott Streets which was acquired by the Pennsylvania General State Authority in 1967 by invoking eminent domain for the reasons of expediting Pitt's expansion following the university joining the Commonwealth System of Higher Education as a \"state-related\" institution in 1966."}}
