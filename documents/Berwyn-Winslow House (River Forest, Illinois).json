{"Berwyn": {"Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)": "The Winslow House is a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house located at 515 Auvergne Place in River Forest, Illinois. A landmark building in Wright\u2019s career, the Winslow house, built in 1893-94, was his first major commission as an independent architect. While the design owes a tremendous debt to the earlier James Charnley House, Wright always considered the Winslow house extremely important to his career."}}
