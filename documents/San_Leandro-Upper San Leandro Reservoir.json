{"San_Leandro": {"Upper San Leandro Reservoir": "Upper San Leandro Reservoir is an artificial lake in Alameda County and Contra Costa County, California which provides water for the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). It is impounded by the earth-filled San Leandro Dam on San Leandro Creek, located at the southeast end of the lake. Although it receives some runoff from its local watershed, most of the water is imported via the Mokelumne Aqueduct."}}
