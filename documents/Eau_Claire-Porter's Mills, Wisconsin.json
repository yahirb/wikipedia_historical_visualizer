{"Eau_Claire": {"Porter's Mills, Wisconsin": "Porter's Mills, also called Porterville, was a logging boomtown in Eau Claire County, Wisconsin, United States, between Brunswick and Eau Claire, at 44\u00b0 46' 15\" N 091\u00b0 34' 01\" W. at an elevation of 771 feet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first sawmill at the site of Porter's Mills was built in 1863. The prime mill sites in Eau Claire had already been taken, so Charles Warner built this mill four miles below Eau Claire on the Chippewa River, near a natural slough which worked reasonably well for holding logs."}}
