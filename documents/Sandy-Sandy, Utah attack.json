This was the result of an apparent domestic dispute between Patterson and his ex-girlfriend Memorez Rackley, who was killed in the attack. Rackley had contacted the police before the incident concerning threats from her ex-boyfriend, and she was ineligible to acquire a protective order because of the nature of their relationship."}}
