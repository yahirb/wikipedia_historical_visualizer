{"Haverhill": {"Dustin House": "The Dustin House or Dustin Garrison House is a historic First Period house at 665 Hilldale Avenue in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Built about 1700, it is one of a very small number of surviving period houses built out of brick in Massachusetts. It is also notable for its association with the Dustin or Duston family; Hannah Duston was famously captured by Native Americans during a 1697 attack on Haverhill, probably while this house was under construction."}}
