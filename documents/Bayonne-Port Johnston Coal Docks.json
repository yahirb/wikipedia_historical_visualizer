{"Bayonne": {"Port Johnston Coal Docks": "The Port Johnston Coal Docks were built on the Kill van Kull at Constable Hook in Bayonne, New Jersey in 1864 by the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The 2,750-foot (840 m) coal dock was named after the company's president John Taylor Johnston. (The former Johnston Yard and today's Johnston Avenue also bear his name)."}}
