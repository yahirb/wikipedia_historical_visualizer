{"Yonkers": {"Fort Cockhill": "Fort Cockhill was an 18th-century military fortification located on Cox's Hill or Tubby Hook Hill, now known as the present-day Inwood Hill Park. A small, circular earthwork structure, in height some ten or twelve feet and equipped with two cannon, it was situated at the northwestern extremity of Tubby Hook Hill, at a point overlooking both the Hudson River and the Harlem River valley.\nBuilt by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, Fort Cockhill, an outpost of Fort Tryon, (which was itself an outpost of Fort Washington to the south), along with a strongly fortified position on Laurel Hill (renamed Fort George after capture by the British), and a four-gun redoubt commanding the Kingsbridge Road, both to the east, provided the rebel defense of the then sparsely populated northern Manhattan."}}
