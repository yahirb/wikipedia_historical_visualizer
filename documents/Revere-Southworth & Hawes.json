{"Revere": {"Southworth & Hawes": "Southworth & Hawes was an early photographic firm in Boston, 1843\u20131863. Its partners, Albert Sands Southworth (1811\u20131894) and Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808\u20131901), have been hailed as the first great American masters of photography, whose work elevated photographic portraits to the level of fine art. Their images are prominent in every major book and collection of early American photography."}}
