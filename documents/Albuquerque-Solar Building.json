{"Albuquerque": {"Solar Building": "In passive solar building design, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.\nThe key to design a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate performing an accurate site analysis."}}
