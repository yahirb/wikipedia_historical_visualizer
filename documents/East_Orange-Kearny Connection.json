{"East_Orange": {"Kearny Connection": "The Kearny Connection in Kearny, New Jersey allows suburban passenger trains from New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex Lines (former Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad) to run to New York Penn Station, instead of their traditional ferry terminal on the river in Hoboken. New Jersey Transit dubbed the new service MidTOWN DIRECT; the connection opened on June 10, 1996. The project took three years, and $70 million to build."}}
