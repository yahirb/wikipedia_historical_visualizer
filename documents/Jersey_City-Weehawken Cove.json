{"Jersey_City": {"Weehawken Cove": "Weehawken Cove is a cove on the west bank of the Hudson River between the New Jersey municipalities of Hoboken to the south and Weehawken to the north. At the perimeter of the cove are completed sections the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, offering views of Manhattan and the Palisades. The name Weehawken comes from the Lenape, and can translate as \"at the end of\", either the Hudson Palisades or the stream which flowed from them into the cove, later the site of the nearby Lincoln Tunnel."}}
