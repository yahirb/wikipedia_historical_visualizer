{"Chicopee": {"Wells Block": "The Wells Block is a historic mixed use commercial and residential block at 250-264 Worthington Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts.\nThe four story Italianate block was built in 1876 for Abner Abbey on the former site of his lumber yard, and was sold to Jerome Wells the following year. The first floor housed a pair of retail storefronts, while the upper floors were operated as a tenement house, boarding house, and hotel until they were extensively damaged by fire in 1946."}}
