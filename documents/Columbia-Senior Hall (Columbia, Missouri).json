{"Columbia": {"Senior Hall (Columbia, Missouri)": "Historic Senior Hall on the Stephens College campus in Columbia, Missouri dates back to 1841, when Oliver Parker bought the eight-acre tract of land on which the College was first located. In 1857, the Columbia Baptist Female College, which later became Stephens College, acquired the building. Until 1918, Historic Senior Hall was the only dormitory at the College."}}
