{"Cincinnati": {"Cincinnati Southern Bridge": "The Cincinnati Southern Bridge, officially the Cincinnati Southern Railroad Swinging Truss Bridge, is a swing bridge that carries the Norfolk Southern Railway over the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio and Ludlow, Kentucky in the United States. The bridge is composed of four through truss spans: a main span on the northern side of the bridge, a currently unused swing span on the southern side, and two additional spans over the main shipping channels in the center of the bridge. The bridge crosses the Ohio River just downstream from downtown Cincinnati, and can be seen clearly from the lower level of the nearby Brent Spence Bridge."}}
