{"Cicero": {"Illinois's 4th congressional district": "The 4th Congressional District of Illinois includes part of Cook County, and has been represented by Democrat Luis Guti\u00e9rrez since January 1993.\nIt was featured by The Economist as one of the most strangely drawn and gerrymandered congressional districts in the country and has been nicknamed \"earmuffs\" due to its shape. It was created after federal courts ordered the creation of a majority-Hispanic district in the Chicago area."}}
