{"Beaverton": {"Cedar Mill, Oregon": "Cedar Mill is a suburb in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area of the United States; it is a census-designated place and an unincorporated community in Washington County, north of U.S. Route 26 and west of the Willamette Stone. It received its name from a sawmill on Cedar Mill Creek, which cut Western Redcedars that were once the dominant tree in the area; the mill's pond was near the intersection of 119th and Cornell Road, which still could have been seen into the 1960s. The name was established in 1874 with the opening of a U.S. post office named Cedar Mill."}}
