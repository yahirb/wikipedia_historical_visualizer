{"Atlanta": {"Confederate Soldiers' Home": "The first Atlanta Confederate Soldiers' Home (also called the Old Soldiers' Home) was built in 1890 with the support of Henry W. Grady at a cost of $45,000. Grady proposed the idea first in 1889, and began to raise funds through \"subscriptions\". Due to lack of funds the home did not open until 1900."}}
