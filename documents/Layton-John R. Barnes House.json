{"Layton": {"John R. Barnes House": "The John R. Barnes House, at 10 S. 100 West in Kaysville, Utah, was built in 1869. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nThe house is significant for its association with John R. Barnes, \"the dominant economic figure in Kaysville during the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries\", and for reflecting his attempts \"to maintain a residence fully consistent with his economic status and social position.\" It was built first as a modest adobe building, then updated to a folk/vernacular plan, then expanded with a Victorian style addition."}}
