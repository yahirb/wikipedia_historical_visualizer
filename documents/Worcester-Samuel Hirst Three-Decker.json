{"Worcester": {"Samuel Hirst Three-Decker": "The Samuel Hirst Three-Decker is a historic triple decker at 90 Lovell Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is a well-preserved example of a Colonial Revival house built late in Worcester's westward expansion of triple-decker construction. It follows a typical side hall plan, with a distinctive front porch supported by paired square pillars through all three levels."}}
