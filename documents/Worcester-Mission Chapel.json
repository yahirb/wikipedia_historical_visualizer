{"Worcester": {"Mission Chapel": "The Mission Chapel is an historic church at 205 Summer Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. A rare example of the early Victorian Norman (or \"Romanesque in panel\") styling, it was built by Ichabod Washburn in 1854, and is one of the city's oldest church buildings. The exterior side walls are divided into bays separated by piers which rise to a layer of corbelling, with a second layer of corbelling just below the eave."}}
