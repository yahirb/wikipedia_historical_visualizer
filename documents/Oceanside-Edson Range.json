{"Oceanside": {"Edson Range": "Edson Range is a firing range complex at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, California. It is named for Marine Major General \"Red Mike\" Edson, \"a World War II Medal of Honor recipient and a distinguished small arms marksman proponent.\" This rifle-qualification complex is home to four of the largest firing ranges on the base. The range became operational on August 21, 1964, the same day that Camp Calvin B. Matthews, in La Jolla, Calif., was closed and turned over to the University of California."}}
