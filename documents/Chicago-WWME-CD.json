The station is owned by locally based Weigel Broadcasting, and is sister to fellow Weigel flagship properties, independent stations WCIU-TV (channel 26) and WMEU-CD (channel 48). All three stations share studio facilities located on Halsted Street (between Washington Boulevard and Madison Street) in the Greektown neighborhood; WWME-CD's transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop.\nEven though WWME has a digital signal of its own, the low-powered broadcasting radius does not reach the outer ring of Chicago proper or surrounding suburbs."}}
