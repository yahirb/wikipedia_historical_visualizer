{"New_Orleans": {"Vieux Carre Property Owners, Residents and Associates \u2013 VCPORA": "Vieux Carr\u00e9 Property Owners, Residents, and Associates ( VCPORA ), organized in the 1920s, is a pioneer organization in the historic preservation movement that grew out of several grass roots efforts to protect the 200-year-old Vieux Carr\u00e9 from decay and demolition. In 1936 the Louisiana state legislature passed a constitutional amendment authorizing the historic preservation of the Vieux Carr\u00e9. Two years later on June 8, 1938 the neighborhood organization incorporated as a non-profit dedicated to the preservation, restoration, beautification and general betterment of the Vieux Carr\u00e9."}}
