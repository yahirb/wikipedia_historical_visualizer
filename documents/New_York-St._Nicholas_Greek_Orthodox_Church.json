{"New_York": {"St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church": "The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (officially the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine) is a church under construction as part of the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York. The church is being developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.\nPlanned to open in late 2018, the church is located in Liberty Park, overlooking the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Its dome is inspired by the world-famous Byzantine Church of the Savior in Edirnekap\u0131, Istanbul. It will contain a meditation/bereavement space and a community room housed in the upper levels above the Narthex \"to welcome visitors and faithful.\" According to its official website, the new \"Saint Nicholas would welcome all and be a House of Prayer for all people.\"\nIt will replace the original church of the same name located at 155 Cedar Street, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001 when the South Tower of the original World Trade Center collapsed, 56 minutes after being struck by United Airlines Flight 175. It was the only building not part of the World Trade Center complex to be immediately and completely destroyed as a result of the attacks, although the Deutsche Bank Building next door was later demolished due to severe damage and contamination."}}
