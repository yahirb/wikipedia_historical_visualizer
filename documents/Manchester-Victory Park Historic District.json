{"Manchester": {"Victory Park Historic District": "The Victory Park Historic District of Manchester, New Hampshire, encompasses Victory Park, a city park laid out in 1838, and four buildings that face it across adjacent streets. Originally called Concord Square, Victory Park was laid out by the proprietors of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company who founded Manchester, and was first used as a common area, used by abutters for gardening and grazing. The park was sold by the proprietors to the city for $1 in 1848, conditioned on making alterations that would transform it into a park."}}
