{"Gastonia": {"Hoyle House": "The Hoyle House, also known as Pieter Hieyl Homeplace, is a mid- to late-18th century two-story house in Gaston County, North Carolina, with notable German-American construction features, the main block of which reflects two, and possibly three, phases, but the exact construction dates have not been determined. A major renovation, circa 1810, added a late Georgian and Federal finish, as well as front and rear shed porches. A brick well house and a frame smokehouse, both east of the house, date from the 19th century."}}
