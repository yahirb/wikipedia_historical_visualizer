{"Bayonne": {"Stapleton Heights, Staten Island": "Stapleton Heights (or Stapleton Hill) is a neighborhood in northeastern Staten Island, New York, part of New York City in the United States. It stands on the second of a series of hills that form a \"backbone\" which runs diagonally across the island from northeast to southwest, between Ward Hill (the first of the hills as they rise from Tompkinsville) and Grymes Hill; to the east is Stapleton, which is along the waterfront. It is an upper-middle-class enclave noted for its large older one-family homes, and for its view of Upper New York Bay and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge."}}
