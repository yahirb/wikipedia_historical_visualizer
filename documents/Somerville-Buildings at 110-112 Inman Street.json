{"Somerville": {"Buildings at 110-112 Inman Street": "The Buildings at 110-112 Inman Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts are part of a series of well-preserved Greek Revival duplexes on Inman Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboard siding. It was built in 1845, and features very straightforward Greek Revival styling, most notably in the corner pilasters and the fully pedimented gable end."}}
