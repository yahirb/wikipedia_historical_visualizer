{"Hoover": {"Red Mountain (Birmingham)": "Red Mountain is a long ridge running southwest-northeast and dividing Jones Valley from Shades Valley south of Birmingham, Alabama. It is part of the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian mountains. The Red Mountain Formation of hard Silurian rock strata lies exposed in several long crests, and was named \"Red Mountain\" because of the rust-stained rock faces and prominent seams of red hematite iron ore."}}
