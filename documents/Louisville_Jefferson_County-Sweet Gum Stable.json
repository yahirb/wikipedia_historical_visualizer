Seventh Street in New Albany, Indiana. The property was a stop of the Underground Railroad, ten blocks west of another stop, the Town Clock Church, and a mere block away from the River Jordan for fugitive slaves, the Ohio River. The stable was built in 1877, and consisted of a balloon frame stable with an attached small brick and frame dwelling constructed about 1836."}}
