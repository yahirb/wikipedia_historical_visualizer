{"Westland": {"Winston Churchill High School (Livonia, Michigan)": "Churchill High School, named after Winston Churchill, is one of the three main public high schools (and the most recently built) in the city of Livonia, Michigan, a western suburb of Detroit. The school was created in 1968 as an add-on to the other high schools in Livonia in response to the population boom that the city saw at the time. The first school year (1968\u201369), a sophomore class attended classes at nearby Franklin High School."}}
