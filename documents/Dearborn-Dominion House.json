{"Dearborn": {"Dominion House": "The Dominion House Tavern, built before 1850, is the oldest remaining continuously run tavern in the Windsor-Detroit Border region and one of the oldest in Ontario.\nFrom its commencement it has served and housed many residents and travelers while the stagecoach ran from Windsor to Amherstburg. It has been a licensed tavern since 1869, and a popular inn since the 1880s; frequented often by judges, juries and county government officials until the 1970s when the Sandwich courthouse closed."}}
