The prison, west of Downtown Raleigh, is on 29 acres (12 ha) of land and is bounded by a double wire fence with a razor ribbon on top. NCDOC describes the original building as \"castle-like.\"\n\nInmates built the prison for 14 years, and granite quarried from an area outside of what would become the east wall of the prison was used to build the facility."}}
