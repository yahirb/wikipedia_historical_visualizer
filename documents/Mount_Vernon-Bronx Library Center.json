{"Mount_Vernon": {"Bronx Library Center": "The Bronx Library Center, a branch of the New York Public Library, is located at 310 East Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx, New York City, situated just off Fordham Road, and several blocks away from Grand Concourse.\nThe library opened in January 2006, replacing the Fordham Branch Library, which had served the Bronx previously. At 78,000 square feet (7,200 m2), it serves as the central library for the Bronx, and is the first \"green\" library in New York City with LEED Silver certification; it also has three times as much space as its predecessor."}}
