{"Durham": {"Erwin Mill": "Erwin Mill was a textile mill in Durham, North Carolina that operated between the years of 1893 and 1986. After seeing the success of other cotton mills in the Northeast and locally in Durham, entrepreneur Benjamin N. Duke incorporated the mill in 1892 and recruited William H. Erwin to manage the enterprise. The mill\u2019s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin\u2019s and his successors\u2019 exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers."}}
