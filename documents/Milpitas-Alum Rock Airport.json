{"Milpitas": {"Alum Rock Airport": "The Alum Rock Airport was an early airport in the town of Alum Rock, California. It was in an area now in the city limits of San Jose near the intersection of Alum Rock Avenue and Capitol Avenue. The airport was established in 1919 by Reserve Lieutenant Johnny Johnston after returning from World War I. Much of the early aerial photography of the then-rural Santa Clara Valley, now better known as Silicon Valley, was taken on flights from the Alum Rock Airport."}}
