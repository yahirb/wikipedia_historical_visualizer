{"Spokane": {"Minnehaha Park (Spokane)": "Minnehaha Park is a 39-acre public park located at Euclid Avenue and Havana Street in Spokane, Washington. The land for the park was acquired in 1909 but development did not begin until 1934. Prior to becoming a park the location was a spa, because of a mineral water spring on the site, and a brewery."}}
