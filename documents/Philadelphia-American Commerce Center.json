As of 2018, the Comcast Innovation and Technology Center is under construction on the same site.\nAt 1,510 feet (460 m) tall with 63 floors, the building would have dominated the Philadelphia skyline, standing over 500 ft (150 m) taller than Philadelphia's current tallest building, the Comcast Center."}}
