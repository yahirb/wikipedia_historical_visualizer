{"Huntington_Park": {"City West, Los Angeles": "City West, also known as Central City West, is a name sometimes given to refer to the eastern edge of the neighborhood of Pico-Union in Los Angeles, California. The term is often used by residents, newspapers, and developers, as part of an attempt to include the area immediately west of the 110 Freeway as a part of Downtown Los Angeles. Although City West is occasionally considered either part of Pico-Union or an outlying area of Westlake, its high-rise skyline mimics the adjacent Downtown Financial District more than any other surrounding neighborhood."}}
