{"Camden": {"Centre Avenue (Pittsburgh)": "Centre Avenue is a busy street that is one of several main thoroughfares in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It stretches from Sixth Avenue near the Allegheny County Courthouse to East Liberty.\nBecause of redevelopments to areas at both ends of Centre Avenue, the street is now somewhat shorter than it had been in 1970."}}
