{"Hartford": {"Pratt Street Historic District": "The Pratt Street Historic District of Hartford, Connecticut, encompasses all of Pratt Street, between Main and Trumbull Streets, in the city's downtown. This block, which includes 15 buildings (one of which faces Trumbull Street), is the only place in the city where its typical early 20th-century streetscape is retained. All of the buildings in the district were built between 1830 and 1928, a significant number of them designed by major local architects."}}
