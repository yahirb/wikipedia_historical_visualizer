{"Miami": {"Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony": "The Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony (also called \"Bookville\" by former residents) was an encampment of banished, registered sex offenders who were living beneath the Julia Tuttle Causeway\u2014a highway in Miami, Florida, USA\u2014from 2006 to April 2010. The colony was created by a lobbyist named Ron Book, who wrote ordinances in several different Miami-Dade County cities to restrict convicted sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet (760 m) of schools, parks, bus stops, or homeless shelters. Since Book was also head of the Miami Homeless Trust, he was also in charge of finding housing for the released sexual offenders."}}
