{"Union_City": {"Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area": "Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area is a regional park located in Fremont, CA that is part of the East Bay Regional Parks system. Before being converted into a park, the site was used as a gravel quarry. When water purchased by the public for groundwater recharge of the Niles Cone flooded the gravel pits, the gravel harvesters began to daily pump the seeping water down Alameda Creek into San Francisco Bay."}}
