{"Greeley": {"Rosedale, Colorado": "Rosedale, Colorado is a former municipality in Weld County, Colorado, United States, now a part of the City of Greeley.\nRosedale was founded and incorporated in 1939 to allow the establishment of saloons, bars, and liquor stores to serve the Greeley community; Greeley, established as part of the Union Temperance Colony, was dry. Located on the south side of Greeley and southwest of Colorado State College of Education (today the University of Northern Colorado), the town together with its sister town, Garden City provided a watering hole for the teachers-in-training and faculty of the college and the rest of the population of Greeley."}}
