{"Waltham": {"Simpson House (Newton, Massachusetts)": "The Simpson House is a historic house at 57 Hunnewell Avenue in Newton, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the late 1890s, and is an excellent local example of a well-preserved Queen Anne Victorian with some Colonial Revival features. It has roughly rectangular massing, but is visually diverse, with a number of gables and projections."}}
