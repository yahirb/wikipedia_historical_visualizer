{"North_Las_Vegas": {"Majestic Las Vegas": "Majestic Las Vegas is a cancelled high-rise condominium project that was to be built on property previously occupied by the La Concha Motel on the Las Vegas Strip, in Winchester, Nevada. The project was announced by Majestic Resorts in February 2004, and was to be accompanied by Hilton's Conrad Las Vegas, a Conrad-branded hotel that would operate in a separate high-rise building on the same property. The project was initially expected to open in February 2006."}}
