{"Revere": {"Boston Garden": "Boston Garden was an arena in Boston, United States. Designed by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who also built the third iteration of New York's Madison Square Garden, it opened on November 17, 1928 as \"Boston Madison Square Garden\" (later shortened to just \"Boston Garden\") and outlived its original namesake by 30 years. It was above North Station, a train station which was originally a hub for the Boston and Maine Railroad and is now a hub for MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak trains."}}
