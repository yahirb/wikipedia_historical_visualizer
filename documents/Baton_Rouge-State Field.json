{"Baton_Rouge": {"State Field": "State Field was the home stadium of the Louisiana State University Tigers football team from 1893 to 1924. The field was built on the old downtown campus of LSU. It was located south of the Pentagon Barracks and slightly southwest of the site of the current Louisiana State Capitol Building adjacent to the Hill Memorial Library and George Peabody Hall. The field, known on the campus simply as the \"athletic field\", was later moved to a site with bleachers that was north of the campus' experimental garden, and next to the old armory building. The field was also used for LSU's baseball and basketball teams."}}
