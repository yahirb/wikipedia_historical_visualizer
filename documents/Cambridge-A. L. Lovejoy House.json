{"Cambridge": {"A. L. Lovejoy House": "The A. L. Lovejoy House is a historic house at 30 Warren Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts. The three story wood frame Second Empire house was built in the early 1870s for Alan Lovejoy, a Boston \"fancy goods\" dealer who probably commuted using either the street car or steam rail that served Union Square. The house has a typical Second Empire mansard roof clad in polychrome slate."}}
