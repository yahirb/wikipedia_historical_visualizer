{"Honolulu": {"Thomas Alexander Burningham House": "The Thomas Alexander Burningham House at 2849 Pali Highway in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi, built in 1910, is a good example of the earliest American Craftsman bungalow homes in the city. Its flaired hip roof and stone-and-stucco siding differentiate it from the many gabled, and often half-timbered, bungalows built during the 1920s. The architect was Thomas Gill (the father of Thomas P. Gill), who designed the Oahu Country Club building and many residences in Honolulu between 1899 and 1941."}}
