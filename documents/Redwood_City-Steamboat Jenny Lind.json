{"Redwood_City": {"Steamboat Jenny Lind": "The steamboat Jenny Lind was a ferry that exploded in San Francisco Bay on April 11, 1853 while on course to San Francisco from Alviso, California, killing many residents of Alviso and San Jose. The boiler exploded as the steamboat passed the Redwood City inlet (about 37.54\u00b0N 122.18\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.54; -122.18), minutes after dinner was called for the passengers. Tragically, women and children were seated first at dinner, leading to the worst of the casualties."}}
