{"Renton": {"Marra Farm": "Marra Farm, a 4-acre (1.6 ha) plot of land in Marra-Desimone Park, South Park, Seattle, Washington is one of only two historic agricultural parcels inside Seattle city limits that retains an agricultural use today; the other is Picardo Farm.\nIt was operated from the early 1900s until the 1970s as a truck farm by the Italian American Marra family, and then sold to King County. Little was done with the land until 1997, when several neighborhood residents and one VISTA volunteer began restoration efforts."}}
