{"Boston": {"Longfellow Bridge": "The Longfellow Bridge (also known to locals as the \"Salt-and-Pepper Bridge\" due to the shape of its central towers) carries Massachusetts Route 3, the MBTA Red Line, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. The structure spans the Charles River to connect Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood with the Kendall Square area of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The structure was originally known as the Cambridge Bridge, and a predecessor structure was known as the West Boston Bridge; Boston also continued to use \"West Boston Bridge\" officially for the new bridge."}}
