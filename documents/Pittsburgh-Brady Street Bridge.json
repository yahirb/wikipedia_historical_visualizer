{"Pittsburgh": {"Brady Street Bridge": "The Brady Street Bridge, also known as the South 22nd Street Bridge, was a steel bowstring arch bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which crossed over the Monongahela River at South 22nd Street. It was replaced by the Birmingham Bridge in 1976, and was demolished on May 29, 1978. The bridge's main span was a tied arch with a suspended road deck, with two through-truss side spans, carrying two traffic lanes between Brady Street on the Pittsburgh side and South 22nd Street on the south side."}}
