{"New_York": {"Edward Mooney House": "The Edward Mooney House located at 18 Bowery at the corner of Pell Street in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City was built between 1785 and 1789 for wealthy butcher Edward Mooney on land he purchased after it was confiscated from British Loyalist James De Lancey.\nThe brick house was built in a mixture of Georgian and Federal styles, and is the earliest remaining townhouse in the Early Federal style in the city. It has three stories plus an attic and full basement. The home was located close to the slaughterhouses, holding pens and tanneries where Mooney made his living; he occupied the house until his death c.1800.\nIn 1807 the size of the house was doubled by an addition to the rear. The house would be used as a private residence until the 1820s after which it has served at various times as a hotel, brothel and saloon.\nThe house was designated a New York City landmark in 1966 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976."}}
