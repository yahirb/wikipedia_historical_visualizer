{"Waltham": {"Peacock Farm": "Peacock Farm is a residential neighborhood located in Lexington, Massachusetts. This historic neighborhood was designed by architect Walter Pierce and built between 1952 and 1958 with the goal making modernist homes accessible to those with limited budgets. The 45-acre subdivision had formerly been a wetland where peacocks were raised and took its name from the previous identity of the site."}}
