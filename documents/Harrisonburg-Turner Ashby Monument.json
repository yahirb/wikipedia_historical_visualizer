{"Harrisonburg": {"Turner Ashby Monument": "The Turner Ashby Monument is a memorial placed in 1898 to mark the place at which Confederate Army Colonel Turner Ashby was killed in the 1862 Battle of Good's Farm. It is located at the end of Turner Ashby Lane in a small privately maintained park that is open to the public. It consists of a granite shaft, its sides finished roughly except for the inscription panel, with a similarly cut pyramidal top."}}
