{"Hammond": {"Dyer station": "Dyer is an Amtrak station in Dyer, Indiana, served by the Cardinal and Hoosier State, and is the penultimate westbound station for both trains.\nDyer Station was merely a sheltered platform and a little shelter with just seats before a renovation in 2014, which demolished the 1970s era \"Amshack\" shelter, built a larger station house which was ADA accessible, and repaved the platform and parking lot. It is located near an at-grade crossing of two railroad lines; CSX (formerly the Monon Railroad) and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern."}}
