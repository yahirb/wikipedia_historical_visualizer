{"New_York": {"Western Union Telegraph Building": "The Western Union Building in New York City was built by George B. Post, and was completed in 1875. This building was located at 195 Broadway, and served as a headquarters for the Western Union telegraph company from 1875 until its destruction in 1890. It was 230 feet high, and had ten floors, where 100 telegraph operators worked 24 hours a day.\nThe building was topped by a clock tower, and some claim that this building was the first skyscraper in New York.\nBeginning in 1877, a ball was dropped from the top of the building at exactly noon, triggered by a telegraph from the National Observatory in Washington, D.C. This system, invented by George May Phelps, was later used as the initial reference for Standard railway time in 1883, and would stay in use until 1912.\nThe building was later replaced with the new, taller, AT&T Headquarters at 195 Broadway."}}
