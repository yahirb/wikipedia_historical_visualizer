{"Stamford": {"Turn-of-River Bridge": "The Turn-of-River Bridge, also known as Old North Stamford Road Bridge, is a single-span lenticular pony truss bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company in 1892. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It formerly brought the Old Stamford Road across the Rippowam River, but is now open only to pedestrian traffic, as the road ends shortly before the bridge.\nThe bridge uses the design patented by William O. Douglas in 1878 for a lens-type truss bridge, and is built out of wrought and cast iron, with pin connections, and has a concrete deck. It rests on stone abutments, and has a total span of 53 feet (16 m). It is one of only about twenty lenticular truss bridges remaining in the state. It is now open only to pedestrian traffic."}}
