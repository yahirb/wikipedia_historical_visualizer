{"Glendale": {"Universal City, California": "Universal City is an unincorporated area within the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles County, California, United States. Approximately 415 acres (1.7 km\u00b2) within and around the surrounding area is the property of Universal Pictures, one of the six major film studios in the United States: about 70 percent of the studio's property is inside this unincorporated area, while the remaining 30 percent is within the Los Angeles city limits. This 70 percent portion of the property remains unincorporated in a county island to avoid the City of Los Angeles' business taxes and regulations (the community has a building permit office on site in order to simplify the building process)."}}
