{"Evanston": {"Woman's Christian Temperance Union Administration Building": "The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is an active temperance organization that was among the first organizations of women devoted to social reform with a program that \"linked the religious and the secular through concerted and far-reaching reform strategies based on applied Christianity.\" It was influential in the temperance movement, and supported the 18th Amendment.\nThe WCTU was originally organized on December 23, 1873, in Hillsboro, Ohio, and officially declared at a national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874. It operated at an international level and in the context of religion and reform, including missionary work and woman's suffrage."}}
