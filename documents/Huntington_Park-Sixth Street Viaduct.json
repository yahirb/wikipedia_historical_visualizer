{"Huntington_Park": {"Sixth Street Viaduct": "The Sixth Street Viaduct, also known as the Sixth Street Bridge, was a viaduct bridge that connected the Arts District in Downtown Los Angeles with the Boyle Heights neighborhood. It spanned the Los Angeles River, the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101), and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), as well as Metrolink and Union Pacific railroad tracks and several local streets. Built in 1932, the viaduct was composed of three independent structures: the reinforced concrete west segment, the central steel arch segment over the river, and the reinforced concrete east segment."}}
