{"Scottsdale": {"B. B. Moeur Activity Building": "The B. B. Moeur Activity Building is a structure on the campus of Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. Constructed from 1936 to 1939 by the Works Progress Administration, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 1985, ahead of the typical 50-year requirement for National Register sites, for \"exceptional\" architectural and historical merit. It is the largest WPA-built adobe building in the state."}}
