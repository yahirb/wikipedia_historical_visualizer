{"Newton": {"House at 2212 Commonwealth Avenue": "The House at 2212 Commonwealth Avenue, in the Auburndale section of Newton, Massachusetts, is a rare local example of domestic Gothic Revival architecture. The two story wood frame house was built c. 1845, and is distinguished by its board-and-batten siding, oriel window, crenellated porch decoration, and bracketing in the eaves."}}
