{"Newton": {"Leonard W. Stanley House": "The Leonard W. Stanley House is a historic house at 23\u201325 Taylor Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1855-56 by Leonard Stanley, a policeman. It is one of the oldest houses on the South Side of Waltham, which the city purchased from Newton in 1849, and is an unusual local example of transitional Federal/Italianate styling."}}
