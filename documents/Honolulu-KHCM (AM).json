{"Honolulu": {"KHCM (AM)": "KHCM is a Chinese-Language radio station serving Honolulu, Hawaii. The Salem Communications outlet broadcasts at 880 kHz with a power level of 2 kW.\n\n\n== History ==\nKHCM's history can be traced back to its days on 870 kHz as KAIM, whose previous format was Religious programming. When Salem bought the station in 2000, it wanted to sign the station off the air so it can allow its sister station in Los Angeles, California, to increase its signal coverage."}}
