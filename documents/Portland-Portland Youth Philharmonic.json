{"Portland": {"Portland Youth Philharmonic": "The Portland Youth Philharmonic (PYP) is the oldest youth orchestra in the United States, established in 1924 as the Portland Junior Symphony (PJS). Now based in Portland, Oregon, the orchestra's origin dates back to 1910 when music teacher Mary V. Dodge began playing music for local children in Burns. Dodge purchased instruments for the children and organized the orchestra which would become known as the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra."}}
