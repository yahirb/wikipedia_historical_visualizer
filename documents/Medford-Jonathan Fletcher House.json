{"Medford": {"Jonathan Fletcher House": "The Jonathan Fletcher House is a historic house at 285 High Street in Medford, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built c. 1835; its builder clearly drew inspiration from designs published by Asher Benjamin, and is an excellent example of transitional Federal-Greek Revival architecture."}}
