{"Waltham": {"House at 170 Otis Street": "The House at 170 Otis Street in Newton, Massachusetts is a rare local work of the nationally known Boston architect Hammatt Billings. The two story Second Empire house was built in 1870\u201371 for Charles Ellis and Emma Claflin Ellis, the daughter of William Claflin, then Governor of Massachusetts, whose own home (no longer extant) was in Newtonville. The house's most prominent feature is its mansard-roofed 2 1/2 story tower, topped with iron cresting."}}
