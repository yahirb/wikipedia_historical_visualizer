{"Newton": {"Lyman Street Historic District": "The Lyman Street Historic District is a historic district roughly encompassing Lyman Street between Church and Main Streets in Waltham, Massachusetts. Lyman Street was laid out in 1826 by Theodore Lyman, owner of The Vale, a country estate (now a National Historic Landmark) just to the north. Residential development took place along the street roughly between 1840 and 1900, resulting in a series of fashionable houses in a variety of 19th century architectural styles on the west side of the street."}}
