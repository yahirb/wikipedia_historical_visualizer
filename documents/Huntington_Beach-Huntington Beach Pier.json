{"Huntington_Beach": {"Huntington Beach Pier": "The Huntington Beach Pier is a municipal pier located in Huntington Beach, California, at the west end of Main Street and west of Pacific Coast Highway. At 1,850 feet (560 m) in length, it is one of the longest public piers on the West Coast. (The longest is Oceanside Pier at 1,942 feet (592 m)). The pier is 100 feet (30 m) above sea level.\nThe Huntington Beach Pier is on the California Register of Historical Resources. It is one of 123 historic places and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, California (Ref. No. 89001203).\nOne of the main landmarks of Huntington Beach, also known as \"Surf City, USA\", the pier is the center of the city's prominent beach culture. A popular meeting place for surfers, the ocean waves here are enhanced by a natural effect caused by the edge-diffraction of open ocean swells around Catalina Island, creating consistent surf year-round."}}
