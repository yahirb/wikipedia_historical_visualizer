{"Cincinnati": {"Lillybanks": "Lillybanks is a historic residence in eastern Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built in 1926, it is a stone building with a slate roof. Prepared by John Scudder Adkins, the design of the two-and-a-half-story house is heavily Tudor Revival \u2014 its location atop a hill and behind walls gives it the isolation common to Tudor Revival mansions."}}
