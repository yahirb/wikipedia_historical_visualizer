{"Somerville": {"Norfolk Street Historic District": "The Norfolk Street Historic District is a historic district at Norfolk Street between Suffolk and Austin Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It encompasses two distinct phases of 19th century residential development in the city: a period in the 1840s when a series of Greek Revival cottages was built (on the odd-numbered side of the street), and the 1880s, when four-story \"hotel\" (apartment house) construction predominated (on the even-numbered side of the street). Many of the Greek Revival cottages have been altered, although that at 73 Norfolk is particularly well preserved."}}
