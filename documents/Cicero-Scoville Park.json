{"Cicero": {"Scoville Park": "Scoville Park is a public park in Oak Park, Illinois. Contrary to the name, it is not located on Scoville Avenue, but rather the corner of Oak Park Avenue and Lake Street, next to the Oak Park Public Library. The park is home to a small Playground, a large field that is home to concerts during Sundays in summer, a war memorial statue, tennis courts and the Horse Show Fountain."}}
