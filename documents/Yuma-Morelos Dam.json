{"Yuma": {"Morelos Dam": "After a 1944 United States Mexico Treaty the Morelos Dam was built in 1950 across the Colorado River. It is located about 1 mile (1.6 km) below the junction of the California border and the Colorado River between the town of Los Algodones, Baja California, in northwestern Mexico and Yuma County, Arizona in the southwestern United States. The eastern half of the dam lies inside United States territory; but Mexico is responsible for all maintenance."}}
