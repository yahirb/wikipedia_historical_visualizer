{"Atlanta": {"Renaissance Park (Atlanta)": "Renaissance Park is a 5.4 acres (2.2 ha) park in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. The land was originally part of the Buttermilk Bottom slum which was razed in the 1960s.\nIn a 2007 study, many area residents stated that the park is unusable due to aggressive panhandling, drug sales and use including crack cocaine, public urination, and the threat of being mugged, tying these threats and crimes to individuals using the nearby Peachtree Pine shelter."}}
