{"Sunrise": {"Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop": "The Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop is a 14-screen drive-in theater in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States of America, that doubles as the largest drive-in and largest daily flea market in the world (local broadcast advertising states it to be \"Florida's second-biggest tourist attraction\"). The largest tourist attraction is supposedly Walt Disney World. From 1989-2006 the Hanneford Family Circus had been performing daily (except Tuesdays) in the Swap Shop food court, entertaining the roughly 12 million people who visit each year."}}
