The Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts) is a non-profit \"exhibition and explication space\", \"community research center\", and archive for contemporary photography in Portland, Oregon. It grew to become a \"preeminent West Coast venue where emerging photographers [engage] with 21st-century technologies.\" A non-profit space dedicated to public education, Blue Sky Gallery began by showing local artists and then slowly expanded to national and international artists."}}
