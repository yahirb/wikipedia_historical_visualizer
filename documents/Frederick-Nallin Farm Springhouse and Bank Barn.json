{"Frederick": {"Nallin Farm Springhouse and Bank Barn": "The Nallin Farm Springhouse and Bank Barn are closely associated with the Nallin Farm House on the grounds of Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA. The barn is a good example of a fieldstone-built bank barn with a byre on the lower level and an earth ramp on the opposite side providing access to a haymow.\nThe simple stone springhouse is the source of 3\u00bd acre Nallin Pond. The barn and springhouse were built circa 1800."}}
