{"Bayonne": {"Mulberry Commons": "Mulberry Commons, once called Triangle Park, is a planned public park in Newark, New Jersey. It was first proposed in 2005 to be the centerpiece of 22 acres (8.9 ha) of the city's Downtown surrounded by Gateway Center, Newark Penn Station, Government Center and Prudential Center, an arena which opened in 2007. The city had acquired deed to the park land in conjunction with the construction of the arena, but the project had not been further developed."}}
