{"Oshkosh": {"Rockwell Light": "The Rockwell Light is located on the northern harbor area of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in Winnebago County, Wisconsin.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe lighthouse was thought up by William Bray as a way to mark his harbor as well as the entrance to the Fox River. In 1909 Bray found an architect who drew up the plans but he died in that year before he could carry through with the work."}}
