{"Concord": {"Lafayette Morehouse": "Lafayette Morehouse, previously known as More University, is an intentional community, or commune, established in 1968 in Lafayette, California. The community is known by residents in the area as \"the purple people\", a nickname derived from the community's characteristic use of the color purple on their buildings and on some of their vehicles. \"We tell people that all the houses here are purple so that there is no mistake that one has changed realities should they wander onto our property\"."}}
