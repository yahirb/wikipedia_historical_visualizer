{"Lincoln": {"Nebraska State Capitol": "The Nebraska State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. State of Nebraska and is located in downtown Lincoln. It was designed by New York architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in 1920 and was constructed of Indiana limestone from 1922 to 1932. The capitol houses the primary executive and judicial offices of Nebraska and is home to the Nebraska Legislature\u2014the only state unicameral legislature in the United States.\nThe Nebraska State Capitol is often known as the \"Tower on the Plains,\" and its 400-foot (120 m) tower can be seen as far away as 20 miles. It was the first state capitol to incorporate a functional tower into its design. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the capitol a National Historic Landmark, and in 1997, the Park Service extended the designation to include the capitol grounds, which Ernst H. Herminghaus designed in 1932."}}
