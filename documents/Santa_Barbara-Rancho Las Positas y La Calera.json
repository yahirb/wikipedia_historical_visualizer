{"Santa_Barbara": {"Rancho Las Positas y La Calera": "Rancho Las Positas y La Calera was a 3,282-acre (13.28 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Santa Barbara County, California. The grant consisted of two parts:- \"La Calera\" (The Lime Kiln) given in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Narciso Fabregat, and \"Las Positas\" (Spanish for \"little pools\", the diminutive form of \"las pozas\" - probably referring to water from Veronica Springs) given in 1846 by Governor P\u00edo Pico to Thomas M. Robbins. The grant was the northwest of the pueblo and Presidio of Santa Barbara, and encompassed the present day Hope Ranch."}}
