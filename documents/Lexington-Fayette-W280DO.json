{"Lexington-Fayette": {"W280DO": "W280DO (WiLD 103.9) is an FM translator station licensed to Lexington, Kentucky. It rebroadcasts an Urban Contemporary format from the HD2 subchannel of WLKT. The station, which was launched on July 21, 2011, replaced the translator of EMF's Air 1 affiliate in the Lexington area, 107.1 WLAI. The translator is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., as is its parent station, WLKT. It specializes in current-based Hip-Hop and R&B hits, catering to a young adult audience and is expected to take on full-powered rival WBTF, whose Urban playlist tends to lean slightly conservative. \"WiLD 103.9\" hopes to siphon off 107.9 The Beat's younger demos."}}
