{"Las_Vegas": {"The Drew Las Vegas": "The Drew Las Vegas (formerly known as Fontainebleau Las Vegas) is an unfinished resort, condominium, and casino on the Las Vegas Strip on the 24.5-acre (9.9 ha) site previously occupied by the El Rancho Hotel and Casino and the Algiers Hotel in Winchester, Nevada. It was intended to be a sister property to the well-known 1950s-era Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel. Excluding the nearby Stratosphere observation tower, the Fontainebleau's 68-floor hotel/condominium building is the tallest building in Las Vegas and in the state."}}
