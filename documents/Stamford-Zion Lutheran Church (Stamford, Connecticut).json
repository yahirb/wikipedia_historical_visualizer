{"Stamford": {"Zion Lutheran Church (Stamford, Connecticut)": "The Zion Lutheran Church is a historic Lutheran church building at 132 Glenbrook Road in Stamford, Connecticut. The red brick Gothic Revival structure was built in 1925 by a German immigrant congregation founded in 1897. It is the city's only red brick church. The main facade is dominated by a square tower on the right, which rises only to the height of the roof gable on the left. The gable stands above a large quadruple window set in a slightly pointed arch, which stands above the main entrance, which is recessed in an arched opening.\nThe property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987."}}
