{"Worcester": {"Larchmont (Worcester, Massachusetts)": "Larchmont is a historic house at 36 Butler Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The two story wood frame house was built in 1858 as a country house for Ransom Taylor, one of the city's largest landowners in the latter half of the 19th century. It is a rare surviving Italianate villa, of a type that once dotted the hills of Worcester, and is one of the finest Italianate houses in the city."}}
