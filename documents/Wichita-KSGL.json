{"Wichita": {"KSGL": "KSGL (900 AM) is a Religious/Adult Standards music formatted radio station licensed in Wichita, Kansas, and is owned by Agape Communications Inc.\n\n\n== History ==\nKSGL's format history includes Top 40 as KEYN-AM, mostly simulcasting with its FM counterpart KEYN-FM.\nIn 1977, the KEYN-AM call letters and Top 40 format moved from AM 900 to AM 1410 (formally KWBB in the 1960s and early-1970s and would be the future sister station to KSGL). AM 900 became KSGL and signed on with a Christian format, the first station to carry the format in Wichita since there were no other stations in the market that carried Christian programming full-time on the radio at the time."}}
