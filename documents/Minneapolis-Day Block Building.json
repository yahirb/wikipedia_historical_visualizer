{"Minneapolis": {"Day Block Building": "The Day Block Building is a historic building located in the Mill City District of Downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota at 1103 Washington Ave S. The property was built in 1883 by Leonard Day, a local businessman of the lumber and flour milling trade, who settled in Minneapolis in 1851.\nBetween 1880 and 1930, Minneapolis led the world's flour production, which resulted in the milling district being nicknamed \"Mill City\", a name still used today.\nIt is unknown what the purpose the building served before it became occupied by Peter O Melby, also known as P.O. Melby, who used the basement and ground floor for his furniture-making business, as well as his undertaking services."}}
