{"Boston": {"Suffolk County, Massachusetts": "Suffolk County is a county in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in the United States. As of 2016, the population was 784,230 making it the fourth-most populous county in Massachusetts. The county seat is Boston, the state capital and the largest city in Massachusetts. The county government was abolished in late 1999, and so Suffolk County today functions only as an administrative subdivision of state government and a set of communities grouped together for some statistical purposes. Suffolk County constitutes the core of the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the greater Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area."}}
