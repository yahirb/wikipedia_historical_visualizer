{"Fort_Lauderdale": {"Osborne Reef": "Osborne Reef is an artificial reef off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, constructed of concrete jacks in a 50 feet (15 m) diameter circle.\nIn the 1970s, the reef was the subject of an ambitious expansion project utilizing old and discarded tires. The project ultimately failed, and the \"reef\" has come to be considered an environmental disaster\u2014ultimately doing more harm than good in the coastal Florida waters.\nIn 2007, after several false starts, cleanup efforts began when the United States military took on the project. This cleanup exercise provides the military with a real-world training environment for their diving and recovery personnel, coupled with the benefit of helping the Florida coast without incurring significant costs to the state."}}
