{"Malden": {"Bennington Street Burying Ground": "The Bennington Street Burying Ground is a historic cemetery on Bennington Street, between Swift St. and Harmony St., in East Boston, Massachusetts.\nThe cemetery was established in 1838, in a late version of the traditional rectilinear colonial cemetery, rather than the rural cemetery style that was then just beginning to come into vogue."}}
