The bridge connects Southeast Sandy Street with the Historic Columbia River Highway and is one of only two western entrances to the highway. Karl Billner, who was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal by the Franklin Institute in 1947, designed the bridge, supervised by State Bridge Engineer Charles H. Purcell."}}
