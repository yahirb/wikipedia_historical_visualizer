{"Dallas": {"Praetorian Building": "The Praetorian Building, also known as Stone Place Tower, was a 15-story, 58 m (190 ft) high-rise constructed in 1909 at Main Street and Stone Street in the Main Street District of downtown Dallas, Texas. It was regarded the first skyscraper in Texas and the first skyscraper in the Southwestern United States. Some consider it the first skyscraper in the entire Western United States, depending on the definition of \"the West\", as this title could also go to the 1885 Lumber Exchange Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota).\nThe Praetorian Building remained the tallest building in the city only until 1912. It was 190 feet (58 meters) tall with 15 floors of office space. Plans for its redevelopment were eventually disbanded and the building's deconstruction was completed in the summer of 2013."}}
