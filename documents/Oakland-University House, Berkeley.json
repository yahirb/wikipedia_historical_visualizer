{"Oakland": {"University House, Berkeley": "The University House is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. Designed by the architect Albert Pissis, it was formerly the home of the president of the University of California, but is now the home of the Chancellor of the Berkeley campus.\nIt is actually the only residence in the campus's central core, as all student housing lies outside the core campus (but within walking distance)."}}
