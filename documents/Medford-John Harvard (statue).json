{"Medford": {"John Harvard (statue)": "John Harvard is a sculpture in bronze by Daniel Chester French in Harvard Yard, Cambridge, Massachu\u00adsetts honoring John Harvard (1607\u20131638), whose deathbed bequest to the \"schoale or Colledge\" recently undertaken by the Massachu\u00adsetts Bay Colony was so gratefully received that it was consequently ordered \"that the Colledge agreed upon formerly to bee built at Cambridg shalbee called Harvard Colledge.\"\u200a There being nothing to indicate what John Harvard had looked like, French used a Harvard student collaterally descended from an early Harvard president as inspiration.\nThe statue's inscription\u200d\u2014\u200cJOHN HARVARD  \u2022 \u2009\u2009FOUNDER  \u2022 1638\u200d\u2014\u200cis the subject of an arch polemic, traditionally recited for visitors, questioning whether John Harvard justly merits the honorific founder. According to a Harvard official, the founding of the college was not the act of one but the work of many; John Harvard is therefore considered not the founder, but rather a founder, of the school, though the timeliness and generosity of his contribution have made him the most honored of these."}}
