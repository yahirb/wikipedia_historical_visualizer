{"Camarillo": {"Oxnard Air Force Base": "Oxnard Air Force Base is a former United States Air Force base, located in the city of Camarillo, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nCamarillo Airport was originally established in 1942 when the California State Highway Department constructed an auxiliary landing field with a 5,000 ft (1,500 m) runway, which was later extended to 8,000 ft (2,400 m) in 1951 to accommodate what by then had developed into Oxnard Air Force Base. The airport runway was further extended in 1959 to accommodate jet fighter aircraft such as the Northrop F-89 and McDonnell F-101B, used as part of the Los Angeles Area Air Defense Network."}}
