{"Beaverton": {"Augustus Fanno Farmhouse": "The Augustus Fanno Farmhouse was the home of Augustus Fanno, one of the first European American settlers in what became Washington County in the U.S. state of Oregon. Born in Maine in 1804, Fanno lived in Missouri as a young adult and in 1846 moved to Oregon with his first wife, Martha, and son. After Martha died in childbirth in Linn City in the Willamette Valley, Fanno and his son settled a 640-acre (2.6 km2) donation land claim 12 miles (19 km) to the northwest on a small tributary of the Tualatin River."}}
