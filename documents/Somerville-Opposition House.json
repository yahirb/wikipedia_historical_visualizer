{"Somerville": {"Opposition House": "Opposition House is an historic double house at 2-4 Hancock Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The two story hip-roofed wood frame house was built in 1807 by Judge Francis Dana, who was seeking to prevent the laying of Harvard Street across his estate. Dana's efforts were unsuccessful; the road was routed around this house, which he had sited along the intended route."}}
