{"Carmel": {"Micah Newby House": "Micah Newby House, also known as the Newby-Bick House, is a historic home located in Clay Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. Records indicate that the farm was acquired in August, 1871, by Micah Newby from his father, John Henley Newby. Although no precise date of construction is known, Ovid Newby, grandson of Micah Newby, documented that his father, John Absalom Newby, born 1877, was age four when the family finished the house (circa 1880)."}}
