{"Bellingham": {"Bellingham National Bank Building": "The Bellingham National Bank Building was originally built from 1912 to 1913. It was constructed in a utilitarian commercial style with reinforced concrete. Even though this particular style was common for cities in the midwest and east coast, the building style was a stark contrast for Bellingham's sandstone and rounded arch buildings."}}
