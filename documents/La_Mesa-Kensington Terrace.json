{"La_Mesa": {"Kensington Terrace": "Kensington Terrace was a proposed 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mixed-use development project in the Kensington neighborhood of San Diego, California. The project was controversial. The controversy stemmed partly because of its size compared to the existing neighborhood buildings, and also due to neighborhood concerns regarding the impact on traffic and parking, and the demolition of two historically-authentic single-family houses."}}
