{"Troy": {"Mannsville, Albany County, New York": "Mannsville is a hamlet within the town of Colonie, Albany County, New York. It is a small community west of the city of Watervliet and is inaccessible to the rest of Colonie by car without driving through Watervliet first. Though then-town historian Jean Olton stated in 1987 that Mannsville was no longer considered \"an official hamlet\" of the town it is still listed on the Town of Colonie's Town Historian website as a hamlet (misspelled as Mansville)."}}
