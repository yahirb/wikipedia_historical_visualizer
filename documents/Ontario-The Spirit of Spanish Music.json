{"Ontario": {"The Spirit of Spanish Music": "The Spirit of Spanish Music is a sculpture by Burt William Johnson (25 April 1890\u201427 March 1927). It was commissioned by the Pomona College class of 1915 and placed in the Lebus Court of the Mabel Shaw Bridges Hall of Music at Pomona College, one of a group of buildings conceived for the expansion of Pomona College and built in the mid-1910s by architect Myron Hunt using details of the \"ornamental Spanish style\". \n\nThis style, and the fact that the building where it stands was intended for the study and performance of music, give the sculpture its name."}}
