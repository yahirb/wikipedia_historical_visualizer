{"Arcadia": {"Miss Orton's Classical School for Girls": "Miss Orton's Classical School for Girls was a private girls' school in Pasadena, California. The school, which was run by educator Anna Orton, opened in 1890. The school was designed to prepare girls for a higher education at a college in the Eastern United States, as most secondary schools in Pasadena at the time assumed their students would go to Stanford or Berkeley if they desired further education."}}
