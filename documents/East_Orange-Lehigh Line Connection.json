{"East_Orange": {"Lehigh Line Connection": "The Lehigh Line Connection connects Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC) with the Conrail Lehigh Line 2 miles (3.2 km) south of downtown Newark, New Jersey. It leaves the NEC at Hunter Interlocking, and the line is sometimes called the Hunter Connection. It has been used by New Jersey Transit (NJT) Raritan Valley Line trains since 1997 when it replaced an older connection."}}
