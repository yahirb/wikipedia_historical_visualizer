{"Delray_Beach": {"Delray Beach station": "Delray Beach station is a train station in Delray Beach, Florida, that is served by Tri-Rail and Amtrak. It is located on South Congress Avenue (SR 807), south of West Atlantic Avenue (SR 806) and east of State Road 9.\nThe station officially opened in 1991 after legal squabbles and poor access led Tri-Rail to abandon the historic former Seaboard Air Line Railway depot located a few blocks north."}}
