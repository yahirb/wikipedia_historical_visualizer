{"Newton": {"St. Charles Borromeo Church (Waltham, Massachusetts)": "The St. Charles Borromeo Church is a historic Catholic church building at Hall and Cushing Streets in Waltham, Massachusetts. Built in 1922, it is a high quality example of Italian Renaissance Revival architecture, and is emblematic of the shift on Waltham's south side from a predominantly Protestant population to one of greater diversity."}}
