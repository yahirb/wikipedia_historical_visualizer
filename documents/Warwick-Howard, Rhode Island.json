{"Warwick": {"Howard, Rhode Island": "Howard was originally a farming hamlet in the southern part of Cranston, Rhode Island.\nIn the mid-19th century, most of the land was acquired by the State of Rhode Island to construct a state prison, a poor house, and other state facilities. The Rhode Island State Prison, first built here in 1878, is a stark and imposing gothic structure built of granite block."}}
