{"West_Allis": {"Pabst Building": "The Pabst Building was a 14-story, 235-foot (72 m) tall neo-gothic high-rise building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Built in 1891, it was Milwaukee's first skyscraper, and was the tallest building in Milwaukee until the Milwaukee City Hall was finished four years later. It was demolished in 1981, and the 100 East Wisconsin Building now occupies the site."}}
