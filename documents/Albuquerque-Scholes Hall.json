{"Albuquerque": {"Scholes Hall": "The Black\u2013Scholes  or Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton model is a mathematical model of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. From the partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black\u2013Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price regardless of the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with the risk-neutral rate). The formula led to a boom in options trading and provided mathematical legitimacy to the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world."}}
