{"Everett": {"Everett City Hall": "Everett City Hall is the name given to a building located in Everett, Washington listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building originally served as the city hall when it was built in the 1920s. However, for all practical purposes it no longer serves this role, as the mayor's office and city administration have since relocated to the Wall Street Building a block down the road."}}
