{"Honolulu": {"United States Immigration Office (Honolulu, Hawaii)": "The Chinese in Hawai\u02bbi constitute about 4.7% of the state's population, most of whom (75%) are Cantonese people with ancestors from Zhongshan in Guangdong. This number does not include people of mixed Chinese and Hawaiian descent. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawai\u02bbi (including the Chinese-Hawaiians) are included, they form about 1/3 of Hawaii's entire population."}}
