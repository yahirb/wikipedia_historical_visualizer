{"Taunton": {"Weir Village, Massachusetts": "Weir Village (also known as \"The Weir\") is a village of the city of Taunton in Bristol County, Massachusetts, located about one mile south of the city center on the banks of the Taunton River, near the point where it becomes tidal. The village takes its name from fishing weirs which were placed across the Taunton River from pre-colonial times until the early 20th century, to catch herring (also known as \"alewifes\"). While much of the commercial part of the village lies on the west side of the river, along Weir Street , a dense residential area extends in an easterly direction across the river along Plain and Berkley Streets."}}
