{"Greenville": {"Swamp Rabbit Trail": "The Greenville Health System Swamp Rabbit Trail is a 19.9-mile (32.0 km) multi-use rail trail in Greenville County, South Carolina, that largely follows the bed of a former railroad that had been nicknamed after the indigenous swamp rabbit. South-to-north the current trail begins at Greenville Technical College, crosses the city of Greenville, proceeds through Falls Park and the campus of Furman University, and ends about a mile north of the Travelers Rest city limits.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1999 the city of Greenville created the Greenville County Economic Development Corporation to purchase the roadbed of the abandoned Greenville & Northern Railway for dual use as a greenway and light rail passenger line."}}
