{"Vallejo": {"Vallejo, California": "Vallejo ( v\u0259-LAY-(h)oh; Spanish: [ba\u02c8\u028eexo]) is a waterfront city in Solano County, California, located in the North Bay sub-region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Vallejo is geographically the closest North Bay city to the inner East Bay, so it is sometimes mistakenly associated with that region. The population was 115,942 at the 2010 census."}}
