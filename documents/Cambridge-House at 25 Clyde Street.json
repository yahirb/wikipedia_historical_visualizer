{"Cambridge": {"House at 25 Clyde Street": "The House at 25 Clyde Street in Somerville, Massachusetts is an example of a vernacular brickworker's house in the area. It is estimated to have been built about 1850, when the area was near one of the city's many brickyards. One characteristic common to these houses was the high brick basement wall, which is visible in this house."}}
