{"Medford": {"Wayside Inn (Arlington, Massachusetts)": "The Wayside Inn, once known as the Cutter House, is a historic house at 393 Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington, Massachusetts. The house was built circa 1750 in a simple Georgian style, and is the only half-house of that period still extant in Arlington. The house may have been used as stagecoach stop; it was owned in the 19th century by Philip Whittemore, who also owned a hotel nearer the center."}}
