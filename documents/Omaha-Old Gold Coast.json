{"Omaha": {"Old Gold Coast": "Old Gold Coast is the name of a historic district in south Omaha, Nebraska. With South 10th Street as the central artery, the area was home to neighborhoods such as Little Italy and Forest Hill. The area is referred to as \"old\" because it was replaced in prominence in the late 19th century when a new district usurped its importance."}}
