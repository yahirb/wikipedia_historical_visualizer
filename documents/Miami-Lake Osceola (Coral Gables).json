{"Miami": {"Lake Osceola (Coral Gables)": "Lake Osceola is a man-made, freshwater lake at the center of University of Miami's campus.\n\n\n== History ==\nLake Osceola was initially built as a canal to connect Biscayne Bay and surrounding bodies of water but was later developed into a lake following the University of Miami's construction in the late 1940's. Due to the lake's connection with Biscayne Bay and other natural bodies of water, wildlife began to inhabit following the initial migration of various species of fish and waterfowl."}}
