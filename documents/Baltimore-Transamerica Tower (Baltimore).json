{"Baltimore": {"Transamerica Tower (Baltimore)": "Transamerica Tower (colloquially occasionally still called by its most recent former label, the \"Legg Mason Building\") and originally built as the \"USF&G Building\", serving as headquarters of the United States Fidelity and Guarantee Company, a specialized insurance company founded in Baltimore in 1896, and relocated here from its former complex of three adjoining early 20th Century masonry structures at the southwest corner of South Calvert and Redwood (formerly German Street before World War I) Streets. Later occupied by and known as the Legg-Mason Building, it is a 40-story, 161 m (528 ft) skyscraper completed in 1973 in downtown Baltimore, Maryland at 100 Light Street (postal address) on the city block bounded by South Charles (Maryland Route 139), East Lombard, Light and East Pratt Streets, facing the former \"The Basin\" of the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and the newly iconic Inner Harbor downtown business waterfront redevelopment of the 1970s-80's era.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was one of the first skyscrapers to be constructed using a then-revolutionary method of erecting a towering central reinforced concrete column first containing elevators and service infrastructure conduits and then followed later by the surrounding scaffolding or steel horizontal beams rising floor by floor, and was a magnet for \"sidewalk superintendents\" and passing office workers during its construction during the early 70's."}}
