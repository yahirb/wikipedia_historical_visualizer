{"Chicopee": {"Stearns Building": "The Stearns Building is a historic commercial building at 289-309 Bridge Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. The six-story steel-and-stone building was built in 1912 for the Dunlap Realty Group. It is an early example (and the best preserved) of Neo-Gothic design applied to large office buildings in Springfield, with restrained elements at the lower level and a fully decorated cornice area at the top."}}
