{"Albuquerque": {"Albuquerque Little Theatre": "The Albuquerque Little Theatre was founded in 1930 by a group of civic-minded citizens led by Irene Fisher, a reporter and the society editor for the New Mexico Tribune. The idea of a local theatre group was born when Fisher attended a lecture by a professional actress named Kathryn Kennedy O'Connor who moved to New Mexico for health reasons in 1927. Fisher led the campaign to raise an operating budget of $1,000 and O'Connor was hired as the theatre's director."}}
