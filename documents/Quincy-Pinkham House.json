{"Quincy": {"Pinkham House": "The Pinkham House is a historic house at 79 Winthrop Avenue in the Wollaston Heights neighborhood of Quincy, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the 1870s by George Pinkham, the manager of the Wollaston Land Company, which developed Wollaston Heights, and is the only house in Quincy that has a direct association with the Pinkham family. The house is a handsome example of Second Empire styling, with a dormered flared mansard roof, quoined corners, and bracketed eaves."}}
