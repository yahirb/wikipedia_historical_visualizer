{"Fort_Lauderdale": {"International Game Fish Association": "The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is the leading authority on angling pursuits and the keeper of the most current World Record fishing catches by fish categories. Fishermen who are sport fishers are careful to follow their stringent rules for fair play and line requirements in order to receive the honor of being listed in their annual \"World Record Game Fishes\" publication. The publication also gives fishing tips, and has an extensive fish identification guide. The IGFA is also an ardent proponent of aquatic habitat conservation, and cooperates with biologists all over the world.\nIGFA is headquartered, along with the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame & Museum, in Dania Beach, Florida."}}
