{"Alexandria": {"Ivy Hill Cemetery (Alexandria, Virginia)": "Ivy Hill Cemetery is a cemetery in the Rosemont Historic District of Alexandria, Virginia, United States. Burials began at the site in 1811, when it was a family cemetery, and it received a charter as a community cemetery in 1856. The adjoining residential neighborhood was developed beginning in 1908 as a streetcar suburb of Washington, D.C., as trolley lines of the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon railway extended from Alexandria's nearby Union Station (opened 1905)."}}
