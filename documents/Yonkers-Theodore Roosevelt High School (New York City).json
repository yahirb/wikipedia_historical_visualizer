{"Yonkers": {"Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)": "Theodore Roosevelt High School was a large public high school in the Bronx. Fully named Roosevelt High School, apparently after the eminent Roosevelt family of New York, at its opening in November 1918, it was renamed Theodore Roosevelt High School soon after Theodore Roosevelt died in January 1919. Conducted within the building of school PS 31, the courses trained accounting and secretarial skills, drew snowballing enrollment, and gained more classrooms elsewhere."}}
