{"Irving": {"North Lake College": "North Lake College is a community college that is part of the Dallas County Community College District and is located in the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas between MacArthur Boulevard and Walnut Hill Lane. The school opened in 1977 and features an enrollment of about 5,000 credit students and an additional 3,000 continuing education students. In 2012 a Dallas Area Rapid Transit train station opened on North Lake's central campus, connecting it to downtown Dallas, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and Dallas Love Field on the Orange Line.\nIn 2005 the college purchased a 35.8-acre (145,000 m2) tract of land in Coppell, Texas as the site of a satellite campus, which opened in 2008 as North Lake College - North Campus. The North Campus location in far northwestern Dallas County pulls students not only from Dallas County, but also from neighboring Tarrant County and Denton County. The North Campus is also home to the college's logistics technology program.\nNorth Lake College - South Campus was opened in fall 2009 and is located on the northeast corner of Shady Grove and MacArthur Boulevard in Irving, with the primary purpose of providing educational opportunities for those in need of basic academic skills, language acquisition, and job competencies in the under-served areas of South Irving.\nThe college's specialties include logistics technology, sciences, and the arts, with plays and fine arts shows throughout the school year. North Lake's monthly student newspaper, the News-Register, has won multiple national awards for college publications.\nNorth Lake College should not be confused with North Lakes State College in Queensland, Australia."}}
