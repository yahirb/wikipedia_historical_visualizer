{"Sacramento": {"Edmonds Field": "Edmonds Field was home of the Sacramento Solons, the Pacific Coast League AAA team until 1960 when they moved to Hawaii. On April 12, 1964, prior to it being demolished to make way for a Gemco discount store, the last baseball game played there was an exhibition game between the San Francisco Giants and the Cleveland Indians. That game featured back-to-back home runs by Willie Mays and Willie McCovey, both hit over the towering walls in right center field."}}
