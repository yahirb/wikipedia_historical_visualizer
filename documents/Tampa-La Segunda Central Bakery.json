{"Tampa": {"La Segunda Central Bakery": "La Segunda Central Bakery is a historic purveyor of Cuban bread, pastries, and other baked goods in the Ybor City section of Tampa, Florida. Founded in 1915, it was one of three bakeries begun in a co-op: La Primera, La Segunda and La Tercera. The other two folded and La Segunda was purchased by Juan Mor\u00e9, whose family has continued its operation for four generations."}}
