{"Camden": {"Benjamin Loxley house": "The Benjamin Loxley house was a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania house owned by a major of that name who served in the Continental Army. The house is noted in history as the place where Lydia Darragh, a Quaker patriot, overheard secret British plans and passed them on the next day to General George Washington. Her efforts are believed to have saved the Continental Army from a surprise attack on December 4, 1777 from British General William Howe, who was occupying Philadelphia."}}
