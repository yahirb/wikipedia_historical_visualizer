{"Phoenix": {"Renaissance Square": "Renaissance Square is a high-rise complex located in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. The complex includes two towers: One Renaissance Square at 105.77 m (347.0 ft) with 26 floors, and Two Renaissance Square at 113.39 m (372.0 ft) with 28 floors. Although a part of the same complex, Tower 1 was completed in 1986 while Tower 2 was completed in 1990. Renaissance Square, which is composed of buildings which stand as the sixth- and twelfth-tallest buildings in Phoenix, is entirely an office complex. The two towers are connected by a skyway positioned halfway up the structures.\nErnst & Young has signage rights to Tower 1 while signage rights to Tower 2 are available. Ernst & Young's name and logo can be seen on the northeastern and southwestern elevations. Tower 2 signs are on the east and west elevation.\nDeveloped by Trammell Crow Company, Renaissance Square was sold to the Pauls Corporation in 2005 for US$120 million. Subsequently in late 2007, the Pauls Corporation sold the complex to the Hines U.S. Core Office Fund for US$273 million. It was the second-largest commercial exchange in Phoenix in 2007. In December, 2016 Oaktree Capital Management & Cypress Office Properties purchased the towers from Hines for US$150 million. In late 2017 the project underwent over US$40 million in building renovations. Lee & Associates has the listing assignment to lease the project."}}
