{"Cincinnati": {"American Can Company Building": "The American Can Company Building is a historic former factory in the Northside neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built in 1921, it is a concrete building with a concrete foundation and an asphalt roof; five stories tall, it has a total floor space of approximately 180,000 square feet (17,000 m2). Built by the American Can Company, the factory was used to manufacture can-making machines, rather than producing the cans itself; it remained in operation until closure in 1963."}}
