{"Quincy": {"Mount Hope Cemetery (Boston)": "Mount Hope Cemetery is a historic cemetery in southern Boston, Massachusetts, between the neighborhoods of Roslindale and Mattapan. It was established in 1852 as a private cemetery, and was acquired by the city five years later. It is the city's first cemetery to be laid out in the rural cemetery style, with winding lanes."}}
