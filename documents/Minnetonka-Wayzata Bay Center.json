{"Minnetonka": {"Wayzata Bay Center": "Wayzata Bay Center was an enclosed shopping mall in Wayzata, Minnesota, a suburb of the Twin Cities. Wayzata Bay Center once comprised 127,000 square feet (12,000 m2) of retail space, with approximately 30 stores on one level, but closed in 2011 after the city of Wayzata agreed upon constructing a new facility on the same land. The mall was once owned by Madison Marquette until residents of the city purchased the mall for $16 million in December 2004."}}
