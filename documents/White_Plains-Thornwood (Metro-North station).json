{"White_Plains": {"Thornwood (Metro-North station)": "Thornwood was a station on the Harlem Line of the Metro-North Railroad which served the residents of the hamlet of Thornwood, New York until its closure in 1984. During its existence, the station was one of the most lightly used on the Harlem Line. Prior to closing it had only half the weekday service of the neighboring Hawthorne and Pleasantville stations, and was merely a flag stop for four trains on weekends."}}
