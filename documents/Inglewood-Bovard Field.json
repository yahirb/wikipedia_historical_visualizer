{"Inglewood": {"Bovard Field": "Bovard Field was a stadium in Los Angeles, California, on the campus of the University of Southern California. The Trojans football team played here until they moved to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1923 and it was the home of USC baseball until Dedeaux Field opened in 1974, about 500 yards (460 m) to the northwest. The football stadium and running track held 12,000 people at its peak, and ran southwest to northeast, near and parallel to today's Watt Way."}}
