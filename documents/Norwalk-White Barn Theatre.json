{"Norwalk": {"White Barn Theatre": "The White Barn Theatre was a small theater founded by actress, producer and theater impresario Lucille Lortel on the property of her estate in Norwalk, Connecticut that premiered numerous plays from major playwrights and plays that went on to successful Broadway and Off-Broadway runs.\nLortel founded The theater in 1947 on her 18.4-acre (74,000 m2) estate at the corner of Cranbury Road and Newtown Avenue. The estate straddled both Norwalk and Westport, with about 15.5 acres (63,000 m2) in Norwalk and 2.5 acres (10,000 m2) in Westport, and the theater was sometimes called an institution in Westport, which has more ties to the theater than Norwalk."}}
