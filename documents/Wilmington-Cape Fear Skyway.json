{"Wilmington": {"Cape Fear Skyway": "The Cape Fear Skyway (also called the Cape Fear Crossing) is a proposed limited access toll road and bridge to be built in North Carolina, United States, that would pass through portions of New Hanover and Brunswick counties.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe proposed 9.5-mile (15.3 km) route connects the south-end of Wilmington to Brunswick County, by crossing over the Cape Fear River. It will have a clearance of 225 ft (68.5 m) to allow large tankers or cruise ships to pass underneath and will most likely be a cable-stayed bridge; if it is, it will be one of the largest in the world."}}
