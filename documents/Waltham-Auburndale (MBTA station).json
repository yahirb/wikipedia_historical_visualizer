{"Waltham": {"Auburndale (MBTA station)": "Auburndale is a regional rail station on the MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham/Worcester Line, located next to the Massachusetts Turnpike in Auburndale, Massachusetts near Lasell College. The modern bare station platform, built in 1961, replaced a highly acclaimed 1881 depot building designed by H. H. Richardson. Commuter service at Auburndale is oriented towards rush hour service, but a handful of off-peak locals stop as well, as do all weekend trains."}}
