{"Stamford": {"Shippan": "Shippan is a section of the city of Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe Shippan section borders several other neighborhoods: to the south is Shippan Point, to the west is the South End, to the north is Downtown, to the northeast is the East Side, and to the east is The Cove. A few years ago, a few residents of Shippan Point (a section of Shippan) went to the mayor and asked to make Shippan a town itself, separated from Stamford. This idea was rejected by the mayor of Stamford.\nThe Shippan area includes Shippan Avenue, Elm Street and the smaller streets nearby. The area south of the intersection of Shippan Avenue and Magee Avenue is considered the Shippan Point neighborhood. To the north, the Metro-North train tracks and Interstate 95 separate Shippan from Downtown Stamford."}}
