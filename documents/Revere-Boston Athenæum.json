{"Revere": {"Boston Athen\u00e6um": "The Boston Athen\u00e6um is one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States. It is also one of a number of membership libraries, meaning that patrons pay a yearly subscription fee to use the Athen\u00e6um's services. The institution was founded in 1807 by the Anthology Club of Boston, Massachusetts."}}
