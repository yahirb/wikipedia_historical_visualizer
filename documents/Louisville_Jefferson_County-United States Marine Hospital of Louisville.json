{"Louisville_Jefferson_County": {"United States Marine Hospital of Louisville": "The United States Marine Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, in the Portland neighborhood was built in 1845, and is considered by the National Park Service to be the best remaining antebellum hospital in the United States. Of the seven hospitals built in the mid-19th century by the Marine Hospital Service \"for the benefit of sick seamen, boatmen, and other navigators on the western rivers and lakes.\" It is the only one still standing, even after surviving two tornadoes. The building has been extensively restored to match its appearance in 1899."}}
