{"Fayetteville": {"John McDonnell Field": "John McDonnell Field is the outdoor track facility at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and is home to the Arkansas Razorbacks. The field is named after former head coach John McDonnell, who ended his thirty-six-year collegiate head coaching career as the most successful coach in NCAA track history, attaining a total of 42 NCAA Championships (although the University was stripped of two due to NCAA sanctions) in three different sports with the Razorbacks. Renovated in 2006, it is one of only six International Association of Athletics Federations Class 1 certified tracks in the United States (along with Hutsell-Rosen Track, Hayward Field, Icahn Stadium, UT San Antonio's Park West Athletic Complex and Rock Chalk Park)."}}
