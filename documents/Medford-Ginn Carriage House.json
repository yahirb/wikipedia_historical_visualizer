{"Medford": {"Ginn Carriage House": "The Ginn Carriage House is a historic carriage house at 24 Ginn Road in Winchester, Massachusetts. The building, which has been converted to a residence, is one of two surviving outbuildings (the other is the gardener's house) of the extensive \"Terrace of Oaks\" estate of publisher Edwin Ginn, whose main house was demolished in 1946. The U-shaped brick carriage house, built in 1900, exhibits high quality construction details, and has touches of Georgian Revival styling."}}
