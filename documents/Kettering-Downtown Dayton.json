{"Kettering": {"Downtown Dayton": "Downtown Dayton is the central business district of Dayton, Ohio. Major reinvestment in the downtown area began heavily in the mid-1990s, and continues today with $2 billion in residential, commercial, health, and transportation developments that has or is taking place in the downtown area.\nWhile much of the city's population decamped to surrounding suburbs in the second half of the 20th century, downtown Dayton has begun to gain population again since the early 2000s with over a 90 percent occupancy rate."}}
