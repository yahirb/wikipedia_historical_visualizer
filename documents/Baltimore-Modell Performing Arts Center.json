{"Baltimore": {"Modell Performing Arts Center": "The Modell Performing Arts Center (originally The Music Hall and formerly the Lyric Opera House) is a music venue in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, located close to the University of Baltimore. The building was modeled after the Concertgebouw concert hall in Amsterdam, and it was inaugurated on 31 October 1894 with a performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Australian opera singer Nellie Melba as the featured soloist. Beginning 1904, it was also used for touring performances by the Metropolitan Opera, and from 1950, it was the home of the Baltimore Opera Company until the company's liquidation in 2009."}}
