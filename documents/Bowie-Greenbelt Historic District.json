{"Bowie": {"Greenbelt Historic District": "The Greenbelt Historic District is a national historic district located in Greenbelt, Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. The district preserves the center of one of the few examples of the Garden City Movement in the United States. With its sister cities of Greenhills, Ohio and Greendale, Wisconsin, Greenbelt was intended to be a \"new town\" that would start with a clean slate to do away with problems of urbanism in favor of a suburban ideal."}}
