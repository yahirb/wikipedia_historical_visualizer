{"Manchester": {"Weston Observatory (Manchester, New Hampshire)": "The Weston Observatory is a historic folly on Oak Hill, Derryfield Park in Manchester, New Hampshire. It is a five-story granite tower standing 66 feet (20 m) tall, which was built in 1897 by the city using funds bequested by James A. Weston, a Manchester native who served twice as Governor of New Hampshire. It was originally open to the public during the warmer months of the year, but was commandeered for military use during the Second World War, and was thereafter used to house police transmitters."}}
