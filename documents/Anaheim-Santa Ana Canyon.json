{"Anaheim": {"Santa Ana Canyon": "Santa Ana Canyon (or the Santa Ana Narrows) is the water gap where the Santa Ana River passes between the Santa Ana Mountains and the Chino Hills, near the intersection of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. It receives particularly strong Santa Ana winds in comparison to surrounding areas, hence the name.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, U.S. Route 91 ran through the canyon; however, it has long since been re-signed or upgraded along the entirety of its former right-of-way in the state."}}
