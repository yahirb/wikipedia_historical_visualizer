{"New_York": {"St. Paul Building": "The St. Paul Building was a skyscraper in New York City built in 1898 to designs by George B. Post that repeated the same Ionic order for each floor, to little cumulative effect. At 315 feet (96 m) it was one of the tallest skyscrapers of its era. The building was 26 stories tall. It was demolished without public expression of regret in 1958 in order to make way for the Western Electric Building.\nThe building received its name from St. Paul's Chapel which is located directly across Broadway from the tower's site in lower Manhattan."}}
