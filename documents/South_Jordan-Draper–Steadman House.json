{"South_Jordan": {"Draper\u2013Steadman House": "The Draper\u2013Steadman House (also known as the Draper\u2013Steadman\u2013Morgan House) is a historic house located at 13518 South 1700 West in Riverton, Utah.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nConstructed in 1894, its NRHP nomination asserted that, \"the house is architecturally significant as one of the best examples of the Victorian Eclectic style in Riverton and as a rare example of the double cross-wing house type.\" Also on the property is one contributing building, originally used as a privy and built from the same bricks as the main house. There are other non-contributing structures on the property, some of which were apparently destroyed by fire sometime in the late 1970s."}}
