{"Miami": {"Miami Center": "The Miami Center is a high-rise office building located at 201 South Biscayne Boulevard in Downtown Miami, Florida. Although Miami Center is not the city's tallest building, it is a symbol of early downtown. Built in 1983, it is older compared with most of the taller buildings in Miami, which have been built in the last decade."}}
