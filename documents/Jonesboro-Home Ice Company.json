{"Jonesboro": {"Home Ice Company": "The Home Ice Company is a historic industrial building at 700 Cate Avenue in Jonesboro, Arkansas. A two-story wood frame building was erected here in 1907 to house a wagon factory, which in 1920 was enlarged with a Mission Revival facade designed by Henry Lesmeister. From 1929 until 2013 the building was used to house an ice-making operation, and is a rare surviving example of an early ice manufactory."}}
