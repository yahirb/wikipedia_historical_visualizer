{"San_Buenaventura_(Ventura)": {"Feraud General Merchandise Store": "Feraud General Merchandise Store, also known as 1903 Building, was built in 1903 in Ventura, California. Jules Feraud opened the Feraud Bakery and Grocery Store and the bakery stayed in the family until 1944. The brick building is a rare intact example of turn-of-the-century commercial architecture during Second Land Boom (1887 \u2013 1905) after the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived in Ventura."}}
