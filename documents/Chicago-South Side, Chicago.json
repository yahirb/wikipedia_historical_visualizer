{"Chicago": {"South Side, Chicago": "The South Side is a region of the city of Chicago. It is the largest of the three main regional divisions of the city -- the others being the North Side and the West Side. While there is no side of the city named the East Side -- as Lake Michigan runs along the city's eastern border -- there is an East Side community area located in the far southeastern part of the city."}}
