{"Elgin": {"Wing Park Golf Course": "Wing Park Golf Course in Elgin, Illinois is the \"oldest and best preserved nine-hole municipal golf course in Illinois.\" The course was constructed during a golf course boom in the Chicago area during first few years of the 1900s. The course was named after William H. Wing, who donated the land for a park in 1902. When the Elgin and Belvidere Electric Company was built only a few blocks away, Elgin developed the southern portion of the property to a golf course."}}
