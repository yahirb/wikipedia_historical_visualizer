{"Tampa": {"International Plaza and Bay Street": "International Plaza and Bay Street is a shopping mall located in the Westshore business district of Tampa, Florida. The mall, which opened in 2001, was built to give travelers an option to shop and dine in high-class surroundings, while at the same time be able to stay near Tampa International Airport (which borders the property). In 2006, the Renaissance Hotel Tampa/International Plaza was opened on the premises, making International Plaza one of a handful of malls in the U.S. to have a hotel directly on the mall property."}}
