It can be found at 1600 AM.\nThis station began as KPMO, going on the air July 22, 1947, broadcasting from a trailer in an orange grove. The station later became KWOW and had a country format in the 1960s-1970s, then switched to oldies in the spring of 1972. From 1987 to 1995, the station was known as KMNY (\"Money Radio\") and carried continuous business news and information. At one time, KMNY even had a permanent studio at the Pacific Stock Exchange in Los Angeles. KMNY was sold to Multicultural Broadcasting in 1998, then assumed a mixed English in the morning and Chinese in the evening format before going all-Chinese in 2000.\nIn 1994, it was the flagship station for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes minor league baseball team as it won the California League championship. Six years earlier, it was the local affiliate of the Phoenix Cardinals in that NFL team's first season in the desert Southwest."}}
