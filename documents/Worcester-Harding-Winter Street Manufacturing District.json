{"Worcester": {"Harding-Winter Street Manufacturing District": "The Harding-Winter Street Manufacturing District encompasses a surviving fragment of the 19th century industrial history of Worcester, Massachusetts. The district includes seven brick factory buildings which were built between 1870 and 1898. They are a remnant of a once-extensive manufacturing district that extended further along Franklin and Grafton Streets, but has become fragmented by urban redevelopment and the construction of nearby Interstate 290."}}
