{"Vancouver": {"Slocum House (Vancouver, Washington)": "The Slocum House is a Victorian style house located in Vancouver, Washington, in the United States. The style also has been called Carpenter Victorian to emphasize both the vertical, Italianate features and the skill of craftsmanship, believed to be the work of Edward Slocum, brother of the owner. Ornamental medallions inside the house were signed and included patent dates from 1842 and 1846, although the house is believed by some to have been constructed in 1867."}}
