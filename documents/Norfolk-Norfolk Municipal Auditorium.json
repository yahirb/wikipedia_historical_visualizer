{"Norfolk": {"Norfolk Municipal Auditorium": "Norfolk Municipal Auditorium was a 5,200 seat multi-purpose arena and music venue in Norfolk, Virginia that opened in May 1943. The arena was constructed after the City of Norfolk and the military found a need to construct an entertainment venue in the city after the population of the city doubled between 1938 and 1941 as a result of World War II-related military buildup.\nThe building remains standing but serves as storage and administrative space for the since-added Harrison Opera House."}}
