{"Salt_Lake_City": {"William Hawk Cabin": "The William Hawk Cabin at 458 N. 3rd West, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, is a \"Pennsylvania style\" log cabin that was built between 1848 and 1852. It is significant primarily for its association with William Hawk, whose home it was from 1852 until his death in 1883. William Hawk had extraordinary moments in his life; for one instance he was sent by Mormon Samuel Brannan to carry news from California to Independence, Missouri, via Salt Lake City, that gold had been found at Sutter's Creek."}}
