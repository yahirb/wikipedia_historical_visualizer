{"Medford": {"Henry Swan House": "The Henry Swan House is a historic house at 418 Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built in 1888 by Henry Swan, a Boston poultry dealer who was also active in local politics. The house is a well-preserved example of the sort of late Victorian houses that were once much more typical along Massachusetts Avenue."}}
