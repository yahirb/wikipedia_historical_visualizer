{"Wilmington": {"Wilmington Club": "Wilmington Club, also known as the John Merrick House, is a historic clubhouse located at Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware. It was designed by architect Edmund George Lind and built in 1864, as a three-story, five bay \"T\"-plan brownstone dwelling in the Italianate style. Although oral history suggests that Edmund Lind was the architect of record, numerous newspaper reports from 1863 suggest that the architect was actually Thomas A. Dixon."}}
