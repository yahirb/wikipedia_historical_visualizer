{"North_Charleston": {"Florence Crittenton Home (Charleston, South Carolina)": "The Florence Crittenton Home is significant for its long association with the development of social and child welfare programs in Charleston and for its statewide leadership in caring for the needs of unmarried mothers and their babies. Since its establishment as the Christlove Mission of the King\u2019s Daughters in 1897 by Claudia Tharin, the organization has sheltered women during their pregnancies, provided them with education and employment training, and assisted them to plan for the care of their newborn children. After two years of operation, the program was taken over by the National Florence Crittenton Mission."}}
