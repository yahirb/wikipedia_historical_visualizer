{"Eagan": {"Holz Family Farmstead": "The Holz Family Farmstead included an 80-acre (32 ha) family farm in Eagan in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Ground was broken by the Holz family in the 1870s, and they raised livestock, crops, fruits, and vegetables until 1993. The property had originally been purchased by developers intending to build residences but, in 1995, the city of Eagan purchased the property for use as a living farm museum."}}
