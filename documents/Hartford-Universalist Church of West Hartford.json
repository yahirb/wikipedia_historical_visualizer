{"Hartford": {"Universalist Church of West Hartford": "The Universalist Church of West Hartford is a Unitarian Universalist congregation in West Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church organized in 1821, but it had its origins in Hartford in the late 18th century, during the period when the Congregational church was dominant in the area. At that time, a sizable group of people, influenced by Elhanan Winchester, began to reject Calvinist doctrine and espouse a belief in the universal goodness of God."}}
