{"New_Rochelle": {"Trump Plaza (New Rochelle)": "Trump Plaza is a 40-story luxury residence located in downtown New Rochelle, New York. It was built by Cappelli Enterprises, the same developer that built Trump Tower at City Center in nearby White Plains. Trump Plaza was the tallest building in Westchester County and the tallest building between New York City and Albany until the completion of the 44-story, twin-towered Ritz-Carlton hotel in White Plains."}}
