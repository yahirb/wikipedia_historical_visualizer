{"Lynn": {"Peabody Museum of Salem": "The Peabody Museum of Salem (1915\u20131992), formerly the Peabody Academy of Science (1865\u20131915), was a museum and antiquarian society based in Salem, Massachusetts. The academy was organized in part as a successor to the East India Marine Society (founded 1799), which had become moribund but held a large collection of maritime materials in a museum collection at the East India Marine Hall, built in 1825 on Essex Street. The Peabody Museum was merged with the Essex Institute to form the Peabody Essex Museum in 1992."}}
