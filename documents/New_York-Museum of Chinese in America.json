It is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) education and cultural institution that presents the living history, heritage, culture, and diverse experiences of Chinese Americans through exhibitions, educational services and public programs.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1980 in Manhattan's Chinatown (\u7d10\u7d04\u83ef\u57e0), the museum began as the New York Chinatown History Project by historian John Kuo Wei Tchen and community resident and activist Charles Lai to promote a better understanding of the Chinese American experience and to address the concern that \"the memories and experiences of aging older generations would perish without oral history, photo documentation, research and collecting efforts.\"\nIn 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg."}}
