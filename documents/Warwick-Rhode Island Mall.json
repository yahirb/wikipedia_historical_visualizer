{"Warwick": {"Rhode Island Mall": "Rhode Island Mall was a two-story, enclosed shopping mall located in the city of Warwick, Rhode Island, United States. It opened in October 1967 as the Midland Mall, as the first two-level mall in Warwick, RI. In 1970, Warwick Mall was opened just North of the Midland Mall, across Interstate 295. Although the two malls co-existed for several years, Rhode Island Mall began to lose stores once G. Fox, one of its anchor stores, was converted to Filene's in 1993 and closed in 1997."}}
