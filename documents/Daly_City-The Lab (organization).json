{"Daly_City": {"The Lab (organization)": "The Lab, located in San Francisco's Redstone Building, is a not-for-profit arts organization and performance space founded in 1984.\nThe Lab believes that if it gives artists enough time, space, and funding to realize their vision, the work they produce will change the way we experience the world. These are often small propositions that (like all great art) challenge the familiar ways we perceive value, and so it seeks out extraordinary artists who are underrepresented as a result of gender, class, race, sexuality, or geography, and whose work is not easily defined and therefore monetized."}}
