{"Newton": {"The Country Club": "The Country Club, located in Brookline, Massachusetts, is the oldest country club in the United States.  It holds an important place in golf history, as it is one of the five charter clubs that founded the United States Golf Association, and has hosted numerous USGA tournaments including the 1913 U.S. Open won by then-unknown Francis Ouimet. Today, the club has nearly 1300 members."}}
