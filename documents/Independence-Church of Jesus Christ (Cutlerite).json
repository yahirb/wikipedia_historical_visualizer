{"Independence": {"Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)": "The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) is a denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement headquartered in Independence, Missouri, United States. The church derives its epithet from its founder, Alpheus Cutler, a member of the Nauvoo High Council and of Joseph Smith's Council of Fifty. Cutler justified his establishment of an independent church organization by asserting that God had \"rejected\" Smith's organization\u2014but not his priesthood\u2014following Smith's death, but that Smith had named Cutler to a singular \"Quorum of Seven\" in anticipation of this event, with a unique prerogative to reorganize the church that no one beyond this group possessed."}}
