{"Montgomery": {"Foundation for Moral Law": "The Foundation for Moral Law is a socially conservative, Christian right legal advocacy group based in Montgomery, Alabama.\nThe Foundation was established in 2003 by Republican politician Roy Moore, who was ousted as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the grounds of the Alabama Judicial Building. In 2013, Moore was again elected to the Alabama Supreme Court, but was suspended from the Court in 2016, and resigned in 2017, after ordering Alabama probate judges to ignore federal court decisions on same-sex marriage."}}
