{"Akron": {"Akron YMCA Building": "Akron YMCA Building is a registered historic building in Akron, Ohio, listed in the National Register on October 31, 1980. Although the YMCA is still in the building for which it is named, they no longer own the building, and now lease their space (consisting of exercise and sports facilities, as well as meeting rooms, which cover parts of the first 5 floors) from the owner.\nIn the late 1980s to early 1990s, the main portion of the center of the building underwent extensive remodeling, and now consists of 55 apartment units (some consisting of two-story \"townhouse\" units, including a secured two-level penthouse unit). It also has office space on the first floor and basement level, and has a secured garage in the basement of the building. Tenants of the building are not given access to the YMCA just because they are tenants; a membership must be purchased. Likewise, members of the YMCA do not have access to the apartments or offices, unless they are also leasing space.\nIn 2008, the building was highlighted by the City of Akron, Ohio as one of seven historic landmark buildings in the City of Akron, during a year-long celebration of the history of the city."}}
