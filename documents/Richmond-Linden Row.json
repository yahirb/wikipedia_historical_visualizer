{"Richmond": {"Linden Row": "Linden Row is a set of seven historic rowhouses located in Richmond, Virginia. They were built in 1847 and 1853, and are three-story, Greek Revival style brick veneer townhouses on high basements and topped by a simple white cornice of wood. Each house has an identical Grecian Doric order entrance porch supported by two fluted Doric columns."}}
