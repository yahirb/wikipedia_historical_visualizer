{"Cranston": {"Elm Tree Plat Historic District": "The Elm Tree Plat Historic District encompasses an early 20th-century neighborhood of East Providence, Rhode Island. Developed beginning in 1924, it contains 53 single-family residences and one commercial building, most of which were built between 1925 and 1935 as a streetcar suburb development serving the Providence area. Most of the houses were built by a single pair of developers, Severin Carlson and Carl Johnson, and are one and two-story Bungalow-style houses."}}
