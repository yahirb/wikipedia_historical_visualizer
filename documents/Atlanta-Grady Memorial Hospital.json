{"Atlanta": {"Grady Memorial Hospital": "Grady Memorial Hospital, frequently referred to as Grady Hospital or simply Grady, is the largest hospital in the state of Georgia and the public hospital for the city of Atlanta. It is the fifth-largest public hospital in the United States, as well as one of the busiest Level I trauma centers in the country. Historical segregation of its hospital units meant that it was also called \"The Gradys,\" a name that still surfaces among elderly Atlanta residents, especially African-Americans."}}
