{"Wilmington": {"Wilmington Rail Viaduct": "The Wilmington Rail Viaduct is a series of fills and bridges, about 4 miles (6.4 km) long, that carry the Northeast Corridor through the city of Wilmington, Delaware above street level. Constructed between 1902 and 1908, the structure consists principally of fills supported by heavy stone retaining walls, punctuated with plate girder bridges over streets, and augmented by a few sections of brick arch viaduct. Its construction is typical of the Pennsylvania Railroad's architectural practices at the time, and the viaduct has been documented by the Historic American Engineering Record and listed on the National Register of Historic Places."}}
