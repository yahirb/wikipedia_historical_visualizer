{"Santee": {"Foster, San Diego County, California": "Foster was a settlement in east San Diego County, California. It was located approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north of Lakeside, near the present-day location of the San Vicente Dam. It was the terminus of the San Diego, Cuyamaca, and Eastern Railroad from 1889, when the railroad reached the town, until 1916, when parts of the railway between Lakeside and Foster were damaged by floods; this also marked the end of the town."}}
