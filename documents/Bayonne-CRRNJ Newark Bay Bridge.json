{"Bayonne": {"CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge": "The Newark Bay Bridge of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) was a four-track railroad bridge that had four main lift spans. It opened in 1926, replacing an outdated two track bascule span built in 1901, that in turn had replaced a wooden draw bridge that originally opened on 29 July 1864. The bridge served the main line of the CNJ, carrying daily interstate trains as well as commuter trains."}}
