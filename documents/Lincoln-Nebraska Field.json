{"Lincoln": {"Nebraska Field": "Nebraska Field was an American football stadium in the midwestern United States, located in Lincoln, Nebraska. At the northeast corner of North 10th Street and North \"T\" Street, it was the home field of the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers from 1909 through 1922.\nNebraska Field was succeeded by the new Memorial Stadium in 1923, which was built in the same location. The local portion of North 10th Street was eventually renamed Stadium Drive in the years following the completion of Memorial Stadium. The present playing field at Memorial Stadium is conventionally aligned north-south, but Nebraska Field was oriented east-west.\n\nNebraska Field's exact capacity is not recorded, but the largest recorded attendance was 16,000 in its final game, against Notre Dame on November 30, 1922. It was the first of only two losses for the legendary Four Horsemen of Notre Dame (the other was also in Lincoln in the following season), Notre Dame was undefeated in 1924.\n\nThe final game at Nebraska Field in 1922 was also the last attended by Nebraska's longtime trainer Jack Best, who had served since the program's inception in 1890."}}
