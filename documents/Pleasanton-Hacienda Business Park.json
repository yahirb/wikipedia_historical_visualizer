{"Pleasanton": {"Hacienda Business Park": "Hacienda Business Park is a 900 acre (364 hectare) mixed-use job center and housing development in Pleasanton, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nApproved in 1982 and ratified by Pleasanton voters in 1983, the business park covers approximately 20 square blocks and features many multi-story office buildings and headquarters for mid-sized companies. It was envisioned by local and county planners as a location for office space that would be less expensive than that of Silicon Valley or San Francisco, close to affordable housing in Pleasanton and nearby Dublin as well as the homes of existing employees in the San Francisco Bay Area."}}
