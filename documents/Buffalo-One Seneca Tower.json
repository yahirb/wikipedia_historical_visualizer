{"Buffalo": {"One Seneca Tower": "One Seneca Tower is a skyscraper located in downtown Buffalo, New York. The building was formerly known as One HSBC Center (1999-2013) not to be confused with Five Star Bank Plaza, previously known as One HSBC Plaza and One Marine Midland Plaza and prior to that, as Marine Midland Center (1972-1999), its name was changed in 1999 shortly after Marine Midland's parent company HSBC re-branded the bank as HSBC Bank USA. The building was constructed at a cost of $50 million between 1969 and 1972, and contains over 1,200,000 square feet (110,000 m2) of space. Today, the 40 story building still dominates the Buffalo skyline, at 529 feet (161 m) high."}}
