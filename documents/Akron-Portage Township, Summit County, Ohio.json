{"Akron": {"Portage Township, Summit County, Ohio": "Portage Township was one of the 16 original townships in Summit County, Ohio. It was in the middle of Summit County, containing Akron and Cuyahoga Falls and earlier part of Middlebury. Eventually it was absorbed by Akron and Cuyahoga Falls and ceased to exist. When created it occupied survey Town 2, Range 11 in the Western Reserve and was about 25 square miles (65 km2) in area. The township derived its name from the Portage Path which extends from north to south through the middle of the township. (Grant, 1891)\n\n"}}
