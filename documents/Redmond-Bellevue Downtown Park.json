{"Redmond": {"Bellevue Downtown Park": "Bellevue Downtown Park is a 20-acre (81,000 m2) park located in the heart of downtown Bellevue, WA. The park was designed for passive and unstructured use, and as a \"respite from the activities of busy urban life.\"\nThe idea for a park in downtown Bellevue was created from civic and private leadership, which saw the City's potential for shaping its future during a time of rapid growth and development. In the early 1980s, economic forces were rapidly influencing the character of downtown Bellevue. Its center was emerging as a hub for commercial and business activity, and the city was seen as a desirable residential community."}}
