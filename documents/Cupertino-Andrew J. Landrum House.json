{"Cupertino": {"Andrew J. Landrum House": "The Andrew J. Landrum House in Santa Clara, California, was built by Andrew J. Landrum, a prominent Santa Clara pioneer. Constructed in 1875, the house is an example of eclecticism in architectural styles. Landrum combined the then-popular Italianate and Carpenter Gothic styles he found in pattern books, as seen in the corner quoins, the Italianate porch with scroll brackets, gables with cross-bracing and the cruciform interior plan."}}
