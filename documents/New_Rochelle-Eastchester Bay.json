{"New_Rochelle": {"Eastchester Bay": "Eastchester Bay is a protected body of water between City Island and the mainland Bronx, New York. Technically, it is a sound, not a bay, since it is open to larger bodies of water at both ends. The northern end connects via a narrow channel to Pelham Bay (which is also really a sound, since it, in turn, opens onto Long Island Sound)."}}
