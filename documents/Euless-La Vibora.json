{"Euless": {"La Vibora": "La Vibora (The Viper) is a steel bobsled roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ride's cars do not run on conventional tubular rails, but instead travel through a winding half-pipe trough that emulates the experience of riding a bobsled. In keeping with the Texas location the theme was changed from an alpine bobsled ride to a snake theme."}}
