{"Monterey_Park": {"Tournament Park": "Tournament Park is a park and athletics venue on the West Coast of the United States, located in Pasadena, California, a suburb northeast of Los Angeles. Currently maintained by the California Institute of Technology, it was simply known as the \"town lot\" before being renamed \"Tournament Park\" in 1900. Tournament Park gets its name from the Tournament of Roses, and it served as a venue in the early 20th century for events associated with the Tournament, such as chariot races, ostrich races, and even a race between a camel and an elephant."}}
