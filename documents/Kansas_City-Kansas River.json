{"Kansas_City": {"Kansas River": "The Kansas River, also known as the Kaw, is a river in northeastern Kansas in the United States. It is the southwestern-most part of the Missouri River drainage, which is in turn the northwestern-most portion of the extensive Mississippi River drainage. Its two names both come from the Kanza (Kaw) people who once inhabited the area; Kansas was one of the anglicizations of the French transcription Cansez (IPA: [k\u0251\u0303ze]) of the original kk\u0105:ze."}}
