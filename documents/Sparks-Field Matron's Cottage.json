{"Sparks": {"Field Matron's Cottage": "The Field Matron's Cottage, also known as the Stone Building, was built circa 1925 on the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in Sparks, Nevada. The cottage was built to support a Bureau of Indian Affairs program to instruct the 20 acres (8.1 ha) colony's Paiute and Washoe girls in sanitation and housekeeping skills. A \"field matron\" was provided by the Bureau from 1919 to as late as 1938."}}
