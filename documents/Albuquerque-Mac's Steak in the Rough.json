{"Albuquerque": {"Mac's Steak in the Rough": "Mac's Steak in the Rough is a drive-in fast-food restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that serves American and New Mexican cuisine. It used to be a chain of restaurants, but its locations were reduced to a single restaurant. They have begun to expand again, by opening a location inside the Latitudes gas station near the entrance of Intel in Rio Rancho."}}
