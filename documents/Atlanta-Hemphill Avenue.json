{"Atlanta": {"Hemphill Avenue": "The Hemphill Avenue neighborhood was until the late 1960s a multi-racial working-class neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia roughly bounded by 10th Street, Hemphill Avenue, North Avenue and Marietta Street. It contained homes, churches (including Ponders Street Baptist) and schools including the State Street school.\nA 1965 plan to expand Georgia Tech into the neighborhood signaled the beginning of the neighborhood's evacuation over the following years, in most cases by buying the homeowners out."}}
