{"Champaign": {"Greek Revival Cottage (Urbana, Illinois)": "The Greek Revival Cottage is a historic house located in Leal Park in Urbana, Illinois. Built circa 1860, the house is the last remaining Greek Revival home in Champaign-Urbana. As Champaign County was settled in the 1850s, the same time the Greek Revival style's popularity declined, few houses in the county were built in the style."}}
