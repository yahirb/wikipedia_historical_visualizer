{"Cambridge": {"W. A. Mason House": "The W. A. Mason House is an historic house at 87 Raymond Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1846 and extended to the rear in 1867, giving it a T shape. Its massing is Italianate as are its decorative window hoods, but its corner pilasters give it a Greek Revival character."}}
