{"Santa_Clara": {"Fairmont Plaza": "Fairmont Plaza is a 17-story, 79.55 m (261.0 ft) skyscraper in downtown San Jose, California. When completed in 1988 as the Knight-Ridder Building, it was the tallest building in the city; it is currently the sixth. San Jose's first skyscraper, the 1909, seven-story, Garden City Bank & Trust Building, and the 1926, seven-story, American Trust Building were razed on the site to make way for the project."}}
