{"Conway": {"Scull Historic District": "The Scull Historic District encompasses two concrete-block houses at 428 and 432 Conway Boulevard in Conway, Arkansas. These two houses were built about 1928, using a style of ornamental concrete block that were a fashionable building material during the 1920s. Both are single-story structures, with hip roofs and four-column porches recessed under the roof."}}
