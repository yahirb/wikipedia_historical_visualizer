{"Fort_Lauderdale": {"New River Inn": "The New River Inn is a historic site in Fort Lauderdale, Florida located at 231 Southwest 2nd Avenue.\nThe New River Inn was constructed in 1905 by the area's first contractor Edwin T. King. It was commissioned by Nathan Philemon Bryan, a Jacksonville native and US senator.\nThe building was constructed of hollow concrete blocks and sand dredged from the nearby beach setting the standard for modern construction in the region. It included sewer and irrigation systems, running ice water and was lit with carbide lamps.\nThe 24-room building served as a hotel from 1905-1955. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nIn 1976, the Inn became the first out of the two buildings to house the Museum of Discovery and Science as the Discovery Center, and the first floor housed exhibits about natural history, while the second floor housed exhibits about non-natural history, and the exhibits were obselete, so the museum was relocated in 1992, to a much larger facility located one block north and a few blocks west of the Inn, which houses exhibits mainly about science plus a few rides, and even includes an Autonation-IMAX 3D theater with a 5 story high screen, or a 4980 square foot screen.\nThe Inn now serves as a museum showcasing Florida's past and pioneer life. The museum is owned and operated by the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society. Permanent exhibits include: \"Panorama of the Past\" detailing the entire history of the Greater Fort Lauderdale area; a hotel room which has been decorated to appear as a typical hotel room of 1908; and the historic King-Cromartie House built in 1907.\nThe New River Inn is located at 231 SW 2nd Avenue and is open for tours Tuesday through Sunday from Noon to 4 p.m. Admission is $10 and includes a self-guided tour of the New River Inn and a docent-led tour of the 1907 King-Cromartie House and the 1899 Replica School House. Docent-led tours begin at 1 p.m., 2 p.m. and 3 p.m."}}
