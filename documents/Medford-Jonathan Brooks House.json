{"Medford": {"Jonathan Brooks House": "The Jonathan Brooks House is a historic house at 2 Woburn Street in Medford, Massachusetts, United States. The house is estimated to have been built in the 1780s (the property is only described as including a house in 1791), although it may incorporate elements of an older structure. Jonathan Brooks, its owner in 1791, was a tanner and a member of the locally prominent Brooks family which owned much of West Medford at the time."}}
