{"Richmond": {"Sherwood Park (Richmond, Virginia)": "Sherwood Park is one of several historical neighborhoods that comprise the area known as Northside in the city of Richmond, Virginia.\nAmong the streetcar suburbs commissioned in 1891 by local businessman Lewis Ginter, Sherwood Park's original design was laid out in 1892 by the firm of acclaimed landscape architect Frederick Law Ulmsted.  Due to economic, social and political factors during Ginter's lifetime, Olmsted's elegant design of gently curved streets was never realized."}}
