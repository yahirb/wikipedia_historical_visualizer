{"Chicago": {"Page Brothers Building": "The north facade facing Lake Street of the Page Brothers Building, 177-91 North State Street in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States, features the city's last remaining cast iron front. Although this example was built after the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, iron facades were a common construction technique before the fire, and many of the iron fronts melted due to the intense heat. The original 5 story structure was built by John Mills Van Osdel, a prominent post-Fire architect known for buildings in the Jewelers Row District and Old Main at the University of Arkansas."}}
