{"Weymouth_Town": {"Newcomb Place": "Newcomb Place is a historic house at 109 Putnam Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was probably built in the 1850s, and is one of the city's finest side-hall Greek Revival houses. It has a three-bay facade with fully pedimented gable, an entablature that wraps around the house, and front windows with simple projecting lintels."}}
