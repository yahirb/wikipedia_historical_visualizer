{"Toledo": {"Robert Craig Memorial Bridge": "The Robert Craig Memorial Bridge is a four-lane, double-leaf bascule bridge that spans the Maumee River approximately one mile downstream from downtown Toledo, Ohio. The bridge is named in memory of U.S. Army Secound Lieutenant Robert Craig, a Scottish-born Toledoan who posthumously received the Medal of Honor during the Second World War.\nOpening to traffic during January, 1957, the Craig Memorial Bridge was notable as one of the few movable bridges on the Interstate Highway System as it carried Interstate 280 over the Maumee River shipping channel; it remained as such until the June 2007 completion of the Veterans' Glass City Skyway project."}}
