{"Pittsburgh": {"Fallowfield (PAT station)": "Fallowfield is a station on the Port Authority of Allegheny County's light rail network, located in the Beechview neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The high level stop is located at the end of Broadway Avenue, built where the tracks transition from a street to a private right-of-way. The station serves a densely populated residential area through which bus service is limited because of the hilly terrain."}}
