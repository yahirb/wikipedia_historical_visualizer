{"Miami_Gardens": {"WVFW-LD": "WVFW-LD (channel 34) is a Spanish language low-power television station in Miami, Florida which is owned by Liberman Broadcasting and serves as an owned and operated station of the Estrella TV network. Despite its owned status however, because it operates as a low-power station, Estrella TV previously affiliated in Miami with the second subchannel of Sunbeam Television's Fox affiliate, WSVN (channel 7) to provide full-market coverage to South Florida. WSVN-DT2 switched to Light TV on July 14, 2017, temporarily leaving Estrella without much Miami cable coverage."}}
