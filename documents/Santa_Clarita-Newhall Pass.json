{"Santa_Clarita": {"Newhall Pass": "Newhall Pass is a low mountain pass in Los Angeles County, California. Historically called Fremont Pass and San Fernando Pass, with Beale's Cut, it separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the San Gabriel Mountains. Although the pass was originally discovered in August 1769 by Catalan explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0, it eventually was named for Henry Newhall, a significant businessman in the area during the 19th century."}}
