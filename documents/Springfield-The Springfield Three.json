{"Springfield": {"The Springfield Three": "The Springfield Three refers to an unsolved missing persons case that began on June 7, 1992, when friends Suzanne \"Suzie\" Streeter and Stacy McCall, and Streeter's mother, Sherrill Levitt, went missing from Levitt's home in Springfield, Missouri. All of their personal belongings, including cars and purses, were left behind. There were no signs of a struggle, except a broken porch light; there was also a message on the answering machine that police believe might have provided a clue about the disappearances, but it was inadvertently erased."}}
