Tomek House, also known as The Ship House or as the Ferdinand Frederick and Emily Tomek House, is a historic house at 150 Nuttall Road in Riverside, Illinois. It is prominent example of Prairie School design by Frank Lloyd Wright. Designed in 1904 and construction finished in 1906, the Tomek House is a well-preserved example of the style."}}
