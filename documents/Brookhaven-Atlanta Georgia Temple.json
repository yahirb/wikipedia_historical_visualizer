{"Brookhaven": {"Atlanta Georgia Temple": "The Atlanta Georgia Temple (formerly the Atlanta Temple) of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) was the first temple built by the church in the Southeastern United States and the second temple east of the Mississippi River since 1846. Members of the church consider it a literal \"house of God\" comparable to the ancient Israelite temple where, as recorded in Bible, God spoke with Samuel. Emphasizing this belief, the building's fa\u00e7ade bears the inscription \"Holiness to the Lord \u2013 The House of the Lord.\"\nThe announcement to build a temple in Georgia was made by the church's First Presidency in April 1980."}}
