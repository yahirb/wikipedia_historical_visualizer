{"Quincy": {"City Point (MBTA station)": "City Point was a transportation station in South Boston, Massachusetts, at the terminus of the former SL3 branch of the MBTA's Silver Line. It lacked waiting facilities for passengers, and existed solely as a turnaround for the buses on the SL3.\nThe station was closed when the SL3 line was dropped in 2008 due to low ridership."}}
