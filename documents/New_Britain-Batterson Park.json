{"New_Britain": {"Batterson Park": "Batterson Park is a public park owned by the City of Hartford, Connecticut, though located outside the city limits within the nearby towns of West Hartford, and Farmington. It is near Talcott Mountain State Park, and includes a large pond with a state-managed boat launch. The pond was formerly used as reservoir managed by the City Water Department, and became a park sometime after 1928, when the water department turned over the disused land to the city."}}
