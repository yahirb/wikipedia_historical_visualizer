{"Burbank": {"Metromedia Square": "Metromedia Square (later known as Fox Television Center from 1986 to 1996) was a radio and television studio facility located at 5746 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California on the southeastern corner of Sunset and Van Ness Avenue. For decades it was recognizable by the white, ladder-like snake on the building's roof. This work of art was called \"Starsteps\" and was dismantled when ownership of the building changed hands in 2000."}}
