{"Huntington_Beach": {"Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, California": "Historic Wintersburg is an historic site representing over a century of Japanese immigration to the United States. The property consists of six extant structures on a 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) parcel in Huntington Beach, Orange County, California. The C.M. Furuta Gold Fish Farm and the Wintersburg Japanese Mission are recognized nationally by historians as a rare, pre-1913 Japanese pioneer-owned property with intact physical features that convey the progression of Japanese American history. The property is noted as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in the City of Huntington Beach General Plan in 2014.\nHistoric Wintersburg is representative of Orange County's early agricultural history and the West Coast's immigration and civil liberties history. Three generations of Japanese American experience are represented: immigration of the Issei in the late 19th century, exclusion and Alien Land Laws of the early 20th Century, the incarceration of American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II, and the return to California from World War II confinement in 1945.\nThe property's modern history dates to the land purchase by Japanese immigrant pioneers in 1908, as part of the former land holdings of the Rancho Las Bolsas. Its pre history includes centuries of occupation by the Tongva, a native people of California. The effort to save and preserve Historic Wintersburg began several years after the property was sold in 2004, when news became public that the new owner planned re-zoning to commercial / industrial uses demolition of all historic and cultural resources. Preservationists have been working with the current property owner for permission to stabilize the structures to prevent demolition by neglect. The goal of historic preservation is to create a permanent heritage site with public park uses."}}
