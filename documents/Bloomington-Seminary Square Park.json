{"Bloomington": {"Seminary Square Park": "Seminary Square Park, also known as the Seminary Park, is a historic public park located at Bloomington, Monroe County, Indiana. It was established in 1816 by an Act of Congress as the original site of Indiana Seminary, a preparatory school that by 1838 became Indiana University. The first building was erected on the site in 1824, and it remained the school campus until Indiana University moved to its new campus in 1883."}}
