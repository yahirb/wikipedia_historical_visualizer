{"Athens-Clarke_County": {"Sanford Stadium": "Sanford Stadium is the on-campus playing venue for football at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, United States. The 92,746-seat stadium is the tenth-largest stadium in the NCAA. Architecturally, the stadium is known for its numerous expansions over the years that have been carefully planned to fit with the existing \"look\" of the stadium. Games played there are said to be played \"Between the Hedges\" due to the field being surrounded by privet hedges, which have been a part of the design of the stadium since it opened in 1929."}}
