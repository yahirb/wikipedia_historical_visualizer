{"Los_Angeles": {"KBLA": "KBLA (1580 AM) is a radio station licensed in Santa Monica, California, with a Spanish religious radio format as Radio Esperanza 1580 AM. It broadcasts at 1580 kHz with 50,000 watts day and night. Most of this station's signal is dumped over the Pacific Ocean to avoid interference with KQFN (ex-KNIX) 1580 in Phoenix Arizona, which also operates with 50,000 watts day & night as authorized by the FCC. Consequently, the station is heard on a regular basis in Hawaii, via AM nighttime skip. Neither KBLA nor KQFN is considered a clear-channel station because they are classified as Class B using directional antennas."}}
