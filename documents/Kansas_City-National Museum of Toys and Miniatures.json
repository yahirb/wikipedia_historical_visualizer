{"Kansas_City": {"National Museum of Toys and Miniatures": "The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures, formerly known as the Kansas City Toy and Miniature Museum, is located on the campus of the University of Missouri Kansas City in a 38-room Italianate mansion at 52nd and Oak. (Bequeathed to the University in the 1960s, the home was originally designed for physician Herbert Tureman in 1906 by noted architect John McKecknie and completed by 1911.)\nBoasting more than 33,000 square feet of exhibit space and a collection of more than 300,000 items, the museum currently welcomes about 25,000 visitors a year. The museum has undergone two expansions in its more than 30 years of operation, and closed for a $9.2 million renovation (mainly of heating and cooling systems) beginning in 2014, reopening in July, 2015."}}
