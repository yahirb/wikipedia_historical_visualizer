{"Richardson": {"Galleria Dallas": "The Galleria Dallas, an upscale shopping mall and mixed-use development located in north Dallas, Texas, (U.S.), was originally developed by Hines Interests in 1982. The mall was modeled after a similar Hines development, the Houston Galleria, which opened in 1970. Both malls have an ice skating rink and a glass vaulted ceiling that is modeled after the historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy."}}
