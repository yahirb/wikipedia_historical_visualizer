{"Albany": {"Knickerbocker and Arnink Garages": "The Knickerbocker and Arnink Garages were two attached stone buildings located on Hudson Avenue in central Albany, New York, United States. Both were built in the early 20th century; the Knickerbocker garage was added to the Arnink garage 12 years after it was built. In 1980 they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places; nine years later they were both demolished and delisted."}}
