{"Dearborn": {"United Sound Systems": "United Sound Systems is a recording studio and locally designated historic district in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Many popular music artists over the last seventy years have recorded there, including blues musicians like John Lee Hooker (he recorded \"Boogie Chillen'\" there), and funk bands like Funkadelic. The studio was also the site of the first recording for Berry Gordy's Tamla label in 1959, starting what would become Motown Records."}}
