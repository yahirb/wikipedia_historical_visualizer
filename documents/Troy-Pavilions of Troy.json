{"Troy": {"Pavilions of Troy": "Pavilions of Troy is a development design concept for an open-air shopping mall, office center, and residential area on the site of the former KMart international headquarters at 3100 W. Big Beaver Road in the Metro Detroit suburb of Troy, Michigan, United States. However, no work is underway on this project concept. Forbes Frankel Company, which owns the adjacent Somerset Collection mall, acquired the site in 2009 and has not released plans for the site or stated whether they would pursue the project which had been approved for the prior owner of the site."}}
