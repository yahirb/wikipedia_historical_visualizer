{"Hartford": {"Mather Homestead (Hartford, Connecticut)": "The Mather Homestead is a historic house at 2 Mahl Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. Built about 1835, it is a rare surviving example of a 19th-century farmstead in the city. Its adaptive reuse over time is also indicative of the transformation of its surrounds by increasing urbanization."}}
