{"Cincinnati": {"Fifth District School": "The Fifth District School is a 1901 two story, rectangular, unpainted brick structure situated in the Peaselburg neighborhood of Covington, Kentucky, USA. The building comprises 47,308 feet under roof including a 1937 addition measuring 25'x 85'. The Peaselburg neighborhood consists of modest late 19th and early 20th century dwellings, primarily single family residences. The building served as an elementary school from 1902 until its closure in 1972 attributable to a decline in the school age population and the need to upgrade the structure to meet revised Board of Education building codes."}}
