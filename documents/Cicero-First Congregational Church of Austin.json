{"Cicero": {"First Congregational Church of Austin": "First Congregational Church of Austin, also known as Greater Holy Temple of God in Christ, is a historic church at 5701 West Midway Place in Chicago, Illinois. The church was built in 1905 for a Congregational assembly; it was later used by Seventh-Day Adventist, Roman Catholic, and Church of God in Christ congregations. Architect William Eugene Drummond, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, designed the church in the Prairie School style; it is an unusual example of a Prairie School church and was influenced by Wright's Unity Temple."}}
