{"Stamford": {"Samuel Ferris House": "The Samuel Ferris House is a historic house at 1 Cary Street in Greenwich, Connecticut. It is a historic Colonial house that is unusual for its survival on the Boston Post Road in Greenwich. It is also locally significant \"for its long continuous association with the Ferris family, early settlers of this section of Old Greenwich.\" The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nParts of the house may be older than 1760, but the current shape of the house was determined by later renovations. The west bay of the house was added around 1800. The building was moved about 80 feet and put onto a new foundation in the 1920s."}}
