{"Cleveland": {"Chase Financial Plaza": "The Chase Financial Plaza is a 1991-built 14 story 165 foot high rise office building on the Tower City Center property of downtown Cleveland, Ohio. The postmodern building was erected in 1991 when Forest City Enterprises sought to improve the leasing power of the eventual opening of Tower City Center in 1991 which was commenced by Forest City acquiring the ionic Cleveland Union Terminal Group in 1982. The tower's squat appearance is deceiving in the fact that it contains 200,000 square feet of office space. The building closely mirrors its counterpart tower on the other side of the Tower City mall property at West 3rd. Both these structures were built on top of one solid concrete platform that remained from a skyscraper unbuilt in the 1930s  It offers views of the Cleveland skyline and the Cuyahoga River. It was one of the first successful mixed-use buildings in the city of Cleveland. This allows it to cater to many different types of clientele, be they commercial office based, hotel based, retail based, or performance based."}}
