{"Parma": {"Independence Slab": "The Independence Slab originally was a series of petroglyphs carved in an outcropping of native silicious Berea sandstone located in the city of Independence, Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It was discovered by area quarry workers in the mid-1800s who were quarrying building materials for a nearby church. The quarrymen are thought to have likely damaged large portions of the petroglyphs before realizing what they uncovered."}}
