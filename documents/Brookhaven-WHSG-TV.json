{"Brookhaven": {"WHSG-TV": "WHSG-TV, virtual channel 63 (UHF digital channel 44), is a TBN owned-and-operated station serving Atlanta, Georgia, United States that is licensed to Monroe. Owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, WHSG maintains studio facilities on Agape Way in Decatur, and its transmitter is located in North Druid Hills.\nBecause it airs no local content (except for local insertion of the required station identification), it is not carried as a local channel on DirecTV; the national TBN feed is already available."}}
