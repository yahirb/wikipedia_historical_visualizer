{"Somerville": {"Hubbard Park Historic District": "The Hubbard Park Historic District encompasses a residential development and park west of Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The area was originally the estate of Gardiner Hubbard, who had a 6-acre (2.4 ha) estate and house on nearby Brattle Street. In the 1880s Hubbard commissioned architects to build a ring of high quality homes around his mansion, which was demolished in 1939 and is now the site of Hubbard Park."}}
