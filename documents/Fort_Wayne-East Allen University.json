{"Fort_Wayne": {"East Allen University": "East Allen University (EAU) is a high school within the East Allen County School system in Indiana. Part of Paul Harding High School (a traditional grade 7 through 12 junior high / high school), EAU was formed in 2012 after a reorganization that saw the senior high school (grades 9 through 12) divided from the newly created Paul Harding Junior High School (grades 7 and 8).\nNot a university in the traditional sense, the name East Allen University refers to the program offered in which students may obtain both a high school diploma and an associate's degree within the four year (grades 9 - 12) program."}}
