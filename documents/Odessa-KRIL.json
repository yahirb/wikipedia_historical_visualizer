{"Odessa": {"KRIL": "Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world's oceans. The name \"krill\" comes from the Norwegian word krill, meaning \"small fry of fish\", which is also often attributed to species of fish.\nKrill are considered an important trophic level connection \u2013 near the bottom of the food chain \u2013 because they feed on phytoplankton and (to a lesser extent) zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for which krill make up the largest part of their diets."}}
