{"Riverside": {"La Placita, California": "La Placita (originally: La Placita de los Trujillos; nickname: Spanish Town; alternate: San Salvador) is a former settlement and the earliest community established in Riverside County, California, USA. The town was informally established soon after 1843 on the Santa Ana River, across from the town of Agua Mansa. La Placita and Agua Mansa were the first non-native settlements in the San Bernardino Valley. Together, they were referred to as \"San Salvador\", and were the largest settlements between New Mexico and Los Angeles in the 1840s."}}
