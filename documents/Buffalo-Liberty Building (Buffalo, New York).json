{"Buffalo": {"Liberty Building (Buffalo, New York)": "The Liberty Building is located at 420 Main Street, across the Buffalo Metro Rail from Lafayette Square in Buffalo, New York, USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1925, the 23 story office tower is a rare example of Neoclassical architecture. At the time of its completion, the Liberty Building was the largest office building in downtown Buffalo and was built for Liberty Bank to serve as their headquarters. The Liberty Bank was originally called the German American Bank but its name was changed to the Liberty Bank after World War I to remove any connection to that war's main enemy."}}
