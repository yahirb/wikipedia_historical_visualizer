{"Warwick": {"John Waterman Arnold House": "The John Waterman Arnold House is an historic house at 11 Roger Williams Avenue in Warwick, Rhode Island. Built sometime in the late 18th century, it is a two-story five-bay wood-frame structure with a central chimney, and a two-story ell extending to the rear. It distinctively has a fireplace in its cellar, suggesting this area was once used as a kitchen."}}
