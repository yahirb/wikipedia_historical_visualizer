{"Little_Rock": {"Van Frank Cottages": "The Van Frank Cottages are a collection of four small houses at 515-519 East 15th Street and 1510 Park Lane in Little Rock, Arkansas. All are modest single-story single-family buildings with high quality Colonial Revival details. They were built in 1908 for Philip R. Van Frank, a civil engineer who played a major role in the management of the waterways in the Little Rock area, overseeing the construction of locks and dams on the Arkansas and White Rivers."}}
