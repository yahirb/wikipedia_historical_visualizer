{"San_Mateo": {"Laguna Creek (San Mateo County)": "Laguna Creek (Spanish for: Lake Creek) is a perennial stream that flows northwesterly for 2.6-mile (4.2 km) along the San Andreas Fault from Woodside in San Mateo County, California and, after crossing the Phleger Estate and Filoli, enters Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir, where it is a historic tributary to San Mateo Creek. San Mateo Creek then carries its waters over Crystal Springs Dam northeast to San Francisco Bay.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter discovering San Francisco Bay from Sweeney Ridge on November 4, 1769, the Portol\u00e0 expedition descended on what Portol\u00e0 called the Ca\u00f1ada de San Francisco, now known as San Andreas Creek, to its confluence with San Mateo Creek."}}
