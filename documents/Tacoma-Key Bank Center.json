{"Tacoma": {"Key Bank Center": "Key Bank Center, formerly the Puget Sound National Bank Building, is a 16-floor high-rise in Tacoma, Washington. When completed as the National Realty Building in 1911, the 71 m (233 ft) tower was the tallest building in the state of Washington until surpassed by Seattle's Smith Tower in 1914. Key Bank later sold the tower and moved into the building at the corner (1101 Pacific) which now houses the South Puget Sound District Offices of Key Bank as well as its Tacoma Main Branch office."}}
