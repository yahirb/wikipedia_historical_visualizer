{"North_Little_Rock": {"Terminal Warehouse Building": "The Terminal Warehouse Building, also known as Markham Tower East, is a historic commercial building 500 East Markham Street in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. Occupying a full city block, it is a massive four-story brick building, with a central eight-story tower on its Markham Street facade. Built in 1926, it is despite its utilitarian use (now as a mixed-use space), a fine example of Venetian Gothic architecture, and a reminder of the city's long history as an important transportation hub."}}
