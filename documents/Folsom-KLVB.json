{"Folsom": {"KLVB": "KLVB is a radio station serving the Sacramento metropolitan area with a Contemporary Christian format. It broadcasts on FM frequency 99.5 MHz and is a K-LOVE O&O station through Educational Media Foundation Broadcasting, based in nearby Rocklin, California.\nEMF re-launched KLVS in mid-April 2008 to serve the Sacramento area after moving the station in from Grass Valley, but on May 28, it went silent after the Federal Aviation Administration voiced concern over the new 358-foot radio tower the station built in El Dorado Hills."}}
