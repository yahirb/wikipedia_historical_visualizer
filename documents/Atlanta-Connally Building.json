{"Atlanta": {"Connally Building": "The Connally Building is located at 54 Peachtree Street (corner of Alabama Street) in Downtown Atlanta, adjacent to the Underground Atlanta retail center. It is a work of architect William Lee Stoddart, completed in 1916. The building has been so extensively renovated that it bears little resemblance to the original design, other than the terra cotta fa\u00e7ade on the lower stories."}}
