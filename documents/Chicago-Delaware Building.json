{"Chicago": {"Delaware Building": "The Delaware Building is a building in the Chicago Loop built in the massive rebuilding effort after the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. It is significant for being one of the few buildings to maintain its 1870's character, as an Italianate structure, in an area dominated by more modern structures. The building is also notable for its early use of a precast concrete fa\u00e7ade."}}
