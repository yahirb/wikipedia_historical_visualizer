{"Lynn": {"High Rock Tower Reservation": "The High Rock Tower Reservation (or High Rock Tower Park) is a city park of Lynn, Massachusetts. The roughly 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) park encompasses the summit area of a hill with commanding views of the surrounding area, as well as the Atlantic Ocean which is only a half a mile away. The park's principal attraction is the High Rock Tower, a stone structure measuring 85 feet high, built in 1905, replacing an earlier tower built by Jesse Hutchinson of the Hutchinson Family Singers, a politically-active abolitionist singing group that performed throughout the northern United States from the 1840s to about 1880."}}
