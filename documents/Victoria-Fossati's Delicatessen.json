{"Victoria": {"Fossati's Delicatessen": "Fossati's Delicatessen is the oldest deli in Texas, and one of the oldest restaurants in the United States. Located in Victoria, Texas, Fossati's was opened in 1882 by Italian immigrant Fraschio (\"Frank\") Napoleon Fossati. He had the current building constructed in 1895 and moved the deli from a nearby downtown location (actually, Fossati's had changed locations several times, and had, at one time or another, been on every corner of the square in downtown Victoria)."}}
