{"Jersey_City": {"3 World Trade Center": "3 World Trade Center (also known as 175 Greenwich Street) is a skyscraper under construction as part of the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It's located on the east side of the new World Trade Center complex, between where the old 4 & 5 WTC buildings were, and not on the site of the old 3 World Trade Center, which was in the southwest corner. The project lies on the east side of Greenwich Street, across the street from the previous location of the Twin Towers, which were destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001."}}
