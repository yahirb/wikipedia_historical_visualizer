{"Camden": {"Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts": "The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts, INC. (PCC) is an American trade union. It was founded in 1966 by members of Musicians' Protective Union Local #274, American Federation of Musicians (A F of M). Local #274 was chartered in 1935 as a separate Black local because Black musicians were denied membership in the racially segregated Local #77."}}
