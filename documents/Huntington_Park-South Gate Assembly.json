{"Huntington_Park": {"South Gate Assembly": "South Gate Assembly was a General Motors automobile plant located in the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate, California. It opened in 1936 to build B-O-P (Buick-Olds-Pontiac) cars for sale on the west coast. It was the first GM plant to build multiple car lines, resulting from a Depression-spawned move to cut production costs by sharing components and manufacturing."}}
