{"Los_Angeles": {"Los Angeles Police Department Memorial for Fallen Officers": "The Los Angeles Police Department Memorial to Fallen Officers is a monument on an elevated plaza at the LAPD headquarters on 100 West 1st Street in downtown Los Angeles. The memorial was funded by the Los Angeles Police Foundation, who raised the $750,000 through private donations. The original tribute to fallen officers that was located at Parker Center was destroyed in the process of transport when moved to make room for a new jail."}}
