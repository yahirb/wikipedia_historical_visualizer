{"Providence": {"Lincoln Woods State Park": "Lincoln Woods State Park is a public recreation area covering 627 acres (254 ha) around Olney Pond four miles (6.4 km) northwest of Pawtucket in the town of Lincoln, Rhode Island. The state park is known for its giant glacial boulders and the stony nature of its terrain which prevented most of the parkland from being used as farmland or for other development.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamed in honor of President Abraham Lincoln, the park traces its origins to the state's purchase of Quinsnicket Pond and 71 additional acres in 1908."}}
