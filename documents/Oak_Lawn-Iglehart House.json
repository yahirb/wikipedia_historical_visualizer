{"Oak_Lawn": {"Iglehart House": "The Iglehart House is an Italianate style house in the Morgan Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, United States, and one of the city's oldest surviving buildings. Located at 11118 S. Artesian Avenue, the original portion of the house in the back was built in 1857 by an unknown architect for Charles D. Iglehart, whose farmstead comprised the land now bounded by 111th, 115th, and Rockwell streets and Western Avenue. Iglehart's daughter Mary, who was born in the house in 1857, is the first child whose birth is recorded in what would become the village of Morgan Park."}}
