{"Danbury": {"P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company": "The P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company is a historic industrial building on Oil Mill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. Also known as the Oil Mill Road building, it is a large multi-section 4-1/2 story brick structure set on the banks of the Still River. Built in stages over the last two decades of the 19th century, it is the last surviving industrial building associated with the fur-cutting and felt-making elements of the hatting industry which dominated Danbury's economy for many years."}}
