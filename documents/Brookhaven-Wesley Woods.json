{"Brookhaven": {"Wesley Woods": "Wesley Woods was founded in 1954 by leaders of the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church and Emory University to provide care for seniors unable to care for themselves. The Center began its affiliation with Emory\u2019s Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center in the 1980s formalizing its tie with the University. In the late 1990s, that affiliation grew stronger and led to an agreement under which nearby Wesley Woods Center came under Emory\u2019s umbrella."}}
