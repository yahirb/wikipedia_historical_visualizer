{"Chicopee": {"Athol Junction": "Athol Junction is a place in Springfield, Massachusetts named after the rail line that split off to Athol, Massachusetts before The Quabbin Reservoir was flooded. It is located next to I-291 and the tracks now are used for the industrial park and extend to Indian Orchard before stopping. When the line was active the tracks extended over the Chicopee River, into Ludlow, Massachusetts, and on to Athol."}}
