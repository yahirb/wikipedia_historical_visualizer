{"Stamford": {"St. John Fisher Seminary Residence": "St. John Fisher Seminary Residence is sponsored by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Men between the ages of eighteen and forty live at the Seminary while studying subjects based on a liberal arts curriculum, especially philosophy and classical languages, in preparation for graduate theological studies outside of the Diocese. St. John Fisher seminarians are formed to be faithful, perceptive, and well-balanced men. The formation experience at the Seminary is meant to leave an imprint on conscience, character, and manners; it is meant to develop style and to nourish action.\nThe Seminary opened in 1989. During the intervening years, the last two bishops of the Diocese of Bridgeport have appointed the five rectors who have served the seminary community.\nThe average time spent at St. John Fisher Seminary depends on the academic status of the seminarian. This can be anywhere from one to five years.\nSt. John Fisher is located on Newfield Avenue in Stamford, Connecticut. It is located on the campus of Trinity Catholic High School.\nThe residence was originally located in Trumbull, Connecticut until the current larger building became available."}}
