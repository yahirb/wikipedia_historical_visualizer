{"Pomona": {"Indian Hill Mall": "Indian Hill Mall is a former shopping mall in Pomona, California. It has been redeveloped into a multi-use retail, commercial and educational facility and is now known as The Village @ Indian Hill, comprising 650,000 square feet (60,000 m2) on 39 acres (16 ha).\nThe original, open-air mall was built in the mid-1950s as Pomona Valley Center. Its anchor store, a 111,500-square-foot (10,360 m2) Sears, had been dedicated in November 1954. Inline stores included Long's Drugs, F.C. Nash and J.J. Newberry. Between 1967 and 1969, the mall was expanded westward. A 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) Zody's discount store opened in June 1969, as the center's second anchor.\nA name change \u2013 to Indian Hill Mall \u2013 was done in 1975. An enclosing renovation was completed in September 1982. The project was described as \"the largest single commercial development in the city's history\".\nIn 1995, part of the property was acquired by the Pomona Unified School District, which created the nonprofit Pomona Valley Educational Foundation to manage it; the foundation was dissolved in 2010. The conversion of the failing mall into an \"impressive\" educational facility has been cited as one of the chief accomplishments of then-school superintendent Patrick Leier.\nThe expanded property now houses multiple educational facilities which serve more than 2,000 students in grades pre-Kindergarten to 14. An eight-screen movie theater formerly in the mall was closed in September 2005, prompting the theater owner to sue the school district, alleging that the lease had been improperly terminated."}}
