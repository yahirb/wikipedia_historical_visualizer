{"Pompano_Beach": {"Pompano Park": "Pompano Park and Poker, more commonly known simply as Pompano Park, is a standardbred harness racing track located in Pompano Beach, Florida. It is billed as \"The Winter Home of Harness Racing,\" as its tropical South Florida location makes it an ideal alternative for horsemen, when most of the racetracks to the north are subject to racing in snow, ice and bitter cold conditions. The track operates its live racing meet for about ten months out of every year, with a short break during the last half of June through the second week in August."}}
