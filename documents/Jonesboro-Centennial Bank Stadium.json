{"Jonesboro": {"Centennial Bank Stadium": "Centennial Bank Stadium (formerly known as Liberty Bank Stadium) is located on the campus of Arkansas State University and is home to their college football team, the Red Wolves. The stadium was named after the old nickname of the school, the Indians, until the 2007 season when it was renamed ASU Stadium. The venue was again renamed in September 2012 after Liberty Bank donated approximately $5 million to the university, and was renamed in 2013 after Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank."}}
