{"Atlanta": {"Pittsburgh, Atlanta": "Pittsburgh is a neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia, founded in 1883 as a black working-class suburb alongside the Pegram rail shops. It was named Pittsburgh because the industrial area reminded one of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its famous steel mills. Pittsburgh is relatively poor and underdeveloped, but as property values rise in Intown Atlanta neighborhoods, many see hope that this trend will spread to Pittsburgh and bring renewal."}}
