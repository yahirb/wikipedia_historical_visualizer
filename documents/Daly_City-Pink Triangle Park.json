{"Daly_City": {"Pink Triangle Park": "In Nazi Germany, pink triangles (German: Rosa Winkel) were used as one of the Nazi concentration camp badges, used to identify male prisoners who were sent there because of their homosexuality. Every prisoner had to wear a downward-pointing triangle on their jacket, the colour of which was to categorise them by \"kind\". Other colors identified Jewish people (two triangles superimposed as a yellow star), political prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses, \"anti-social\" prisoners, and others the Nazis deemed undesirable."}}
