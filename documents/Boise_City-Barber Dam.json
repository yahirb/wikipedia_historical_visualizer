{"Boise_City": {"Barber Dam": "The Barber Dam is a timber-crib dam on the Boise River located about 3 mi (5 km) east of Boise, Idaho. The dam was constructed by the Barber Lumber Company between 1904 and 1906 to serve as a mill pond for timber. A power plant was also constructed in conjunction with the dam which powered the mill and the town of Barberton (Barber), which was established in 1910."}}
