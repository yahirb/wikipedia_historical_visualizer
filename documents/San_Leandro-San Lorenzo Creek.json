{"San_Leandro": {"San Lorenzo Creek": "San Lorenzo Creek is a 10.7-mile-long (17.2 km) year-round natural stream flowing through Hayward, California, into San Francisco Bay at the Hayward Regional Shoreline.\n\n\n== Watershed ==\nThe creek begins in Castro Valley, and is the main tributary within the San Lorenzo Watershed, including the formerly independent Sulpher Creek, which had most of its flow diverted into San Lorenzo Creek in the 1960s to reduce the risk of flooding in downtown Hayward. Only in large flow events does some of the creek flow follow its old course into the Bay."}}
