{"Bowie": {"Newton White Mansion": "This Neo-Georgian home was built in 1939 by architect William Lawrence Bottomley for Captain Newton H. White of the United States Navy. Captain White had a long and distinguished career, serving on the USS Yorktown, the USS Lexington, and, prior to World War II, as the first commanding officer of the USS Enterprise.\nAt one time the centerpiece of a 586-acre (2.37 km2) dairy farm, the house and grounds (known locally as the Enterprise Estate) are now entirely surrounded by the Enterprise Golf Course."}}
