{"Camden": {"Adelphi School": "The Adelphi School was a Quaker-organized school for poor children that operated between 1808 and 1906 in what is now the Chinatown neighborhood of Philadelphia's Center City. Originally focused on educating white boys during its first several years, it shifted focus to educating black children after the public education system was established in Pennsylvania. The Adelphi School was sustained through charitable donations, at no cost to its students."}}
