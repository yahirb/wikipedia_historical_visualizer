{"Weymouth_Town": {"C. F. Pettengill House": "The C. F. Pettengill House is a historic house at 53 Revere Road in Quincy, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was probably built in the 1890s; it is a finely-detailed version of a Queen Anne style house which was once common in Quincy. Its features include varied gabling and shingle decoratino, as well as a front porch decorated with latticework and turned posts."}}
