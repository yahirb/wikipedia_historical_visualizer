{"Lowell": {"Wannalancit Mills": "The Wannalancit Mills (formerly the Suffolk Mills) in Lowell, Massachusetts is an early American cotton mill, parts of which date to the 1830s at the earliest. Its namesake is a corruption of Wonalancet, a sachem or sagamore of the Penacook Native American tribe. Today the complex is home to office space, conference center, and university research facilities."}}
