{"Baltimore": {"College of Medicine of Maryland": "The College of Medicine of Maryland, or also known since 1959 as Davidge Hall, has been in continuous use for medical education since 1813, the oldest such structure in the United States. A wide pediment stands in front of a low, domed drum structure, which housed the anatomical theater. A circular chemistry hall was housed on the lower level under the anatomical theater."}}
