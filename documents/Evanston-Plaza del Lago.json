{"Evanston": {"Plaza del Lago": "Plaza del Lago is a shopping center at 1515 Sheridan Road in Wilmette, Illinois, United States which opened in 1928 as Spanish Court; it has been reported as the second-oldest shopping center in the United States designed for automobile use, and the first such center in the state of Illinois.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThough the Plaza is in the village of Wilmette today, the tract of land it was built on was originally a part of an undeveloped area known as No Man's Land, a strip of land owned by Henry Gage which, for unclear reasons, was not annexed when the rest of Gage's property was annexed by Wilmette. The area started out as underdeveloped land lined by three gas stations, and Sheridan was unpaved."}}
