{"Kansas_City": {"Sumner Academy of Arts & Science": "Sumner Academy of Arts and Science is a nationally ranked magnet school in Kansas City, Kansas which prepares students for high-level academic and creative pursuits. Named for abolitionist Charles Sumner, it started in 1905 during a period of racial tension as a segregated school for black (\"Negro\") students, which offered vocational training, but emphasized college-preparatory training. Located at 1610 N. 8th Street, the current architecturally significant complex began with its Art Deco core in 1937, but has been repeatedly expanded."}}
