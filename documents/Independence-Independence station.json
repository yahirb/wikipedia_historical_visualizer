{"Independence": {"Independence station": "Independence, also known as Missouri Pacific Depot, is an Amtrak train station in Independence, Missouri, United States. The station was originally built in 1913 by the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and is also known as the \"Truman Depot,\" because it was the final stop in Harry S. Truman's 1948 Whistlestop Campaign where 8,500 admirers welcomed Truman in January 1953 when he returned home after leaving office. Today, the depot is an Amtrak stop and is said to be home to the Jackson County Genealogical Society Research Library."}}
