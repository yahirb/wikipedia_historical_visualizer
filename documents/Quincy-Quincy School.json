{"Quincy": {"Quincy School": "Quincy School is a historic school building at 94 Newbury Avenue in Quincy, Massachusetts. The two-story brick building was built in 1906 and enlarged in 1932; its original design was by Hurd & Gore, and the addition was by Hutchins & French. A longtime elementary school, it closed in 1981 following city cutbacks in the wake of Proposition 2 1/2, and was subsequently sold to private developers for conversion to condominiums."}}
