{"Tulsa": {"University Club Tower (Tulsa)": "The University Club Tower is a residential high-rise building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The building rises 377 feet (115 m). It contains 32 floors, and was completed in 1966. The University Club Tower currently stands as the 8th-tallest building in the city, and the 14th-tallest building in the state of Oklahoma. It also currently stands as the tallest all-residential building in Tulsa and Oklahoma. The circular building, marked by unusual floorplans surrounding its central core, was the first major building in the United States to be designed using a computer.\nIn June 2011, resident Joshua Hilberling fell through a 25th-floor window of the building to his death. His wife, Amber Hilberling, was charged with causing his death by pushing him through the window. She maintained that the building's windows were made of insufficiently strong glass, and she filed a suit against the building for the allegedly unsafe construction of the windows. In March 2013, a Tulsa jury found her guilty of second-degree murder. The case was discussed on a February 2016 episode of the Dr. Phil show. In October 2016 Amber Hilberling was found dead in her cell at the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center near McLoud, Oklahoma; the medical examiner ruled it to be suicide by hanging, but some family members questioned the finding."}}
