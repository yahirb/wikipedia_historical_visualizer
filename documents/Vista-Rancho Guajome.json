{"Vista": {"Rancho Guajome": "Rancho Guajome was a 2,219-acre (8.98 km2) Mexican land grant in present day San Diego County, California given in 1845 by Governor P\u00edo Pico to Andr\u00e9s and Jos\u00e9 Manuel, Indians. The name comes from a Luise\u00f1o phrase involving the word \"frog\", likely wakhavumi \"frog pond\" or wax\u00e1awu-may \"little frog\". The grant was south of San Luis Rey River and Rancho Monserate and north of present day Vista."}}
