{"Atlanta": {"Glenwood Park": "Glenwood Park is a mixed-use neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, located just west of North Ormewood Park. The neighborhood is an example of New Urbanism, promoting a sense of community with walkable streets and closely spaced residential units that are mixed in with office, retail, and green space. Glenwood Park is on the BeltLine, a former rail line converted to a trail, with transit to be constructed in the future."}}
