{"Tampa": {"Tampa Bay Center": "The Tampa Bay Center was a shopping mall located in Tampa, Florida, across the street from Tampa Stadium. When it was opened on August 5, 1976 the 877,000-square-foot (81,500 m2) Tampa Bay Center was Tampa's fourth major mall and operated until 2001, when most of its tenants relocated to the nearby International Plaza. The mall was a two-story building that had an anchor at each end, plus one in the center of the mall: Burdines on the east side, Montgomery Ward in the center, and Sears on the west side."}}
