{"Irving": {"Mustangs at Las Colinas": "Mustangs at Las Colinas is a bronze sculpture by Robert Glen, that decorates Williams Square in Las Colinas in Irving, Texas.\nThe sculpture commemorates the wild mustangs that were historically important inhabitants of much of Texas. It portrays a group at 1.5 times life size, running through a watercourse, with fountains giving the effect of water splashed by the animals' hooves. The horses are intended to represent the drive, initiative and unfettered lifestyle that were fundamental to the state in its pioneer days.\nThe work was commissioned in 1976 and installed in 1984. SWA Group's design created a shallow watercourse extending 400 feet (130 m) from northeast to southwest across Williams Square, a gently sloping granite-paved open space about 300 feet (110 m) square. The plaza setting for the sculpture won a National Honor Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects.\nThe buildings around the square rise 358 feet (26 floors) on the north and 217 feet (14 floors) on the east and west sides, with the south side open to O'Connor Boulevard. The sculpture is substantial, but the scale of the surrounding structures keeps it from dominating the space.\nThe Mustangs of Las Colinas Museum is located adjacent to the sculpture, in East Tower at Williams Square Plaza. The museum features exhibits and a film about the work's creation, as well as additional sculptures by Robert Glen.\nSince its opening in 2012, the statue is accessible from the DART Orange Line\u2019s stops at Las Colinas Urban Center station and Las Colinas Convention Center station."}}
