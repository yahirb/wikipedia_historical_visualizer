{"New_Haven": {"Whitney Avenue": "The Battle of Whitney Avenue refers to the college ice hockey series between Quinnipiac Bobcats and Yale Bulldogs, both currently members of ECAC.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006, the Quinnipiac Bobcats moved to the ECAC. Since then, Quinnipiac and the Yale Bulldogs have become one of biggest non-Ivy rivalries in the ECAC. The rivalry got its name from the fact that the two campuses are separated by a mere eight miles on Whitney Avenue from Hamden to New Haven.\nThe two teams met on April 13, 2013 for the fourth time in the 2012\u201313 season in Pittsburgh to play for the national championship. Although, Quinnipiac had won the previous three meetings (all in the 2012\u201313 season) by a combined score of 13\u20133, Yale shut them out in the 2013 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey National Championship Game, 4\u20130."}}
