{"Daly_City": {"King Philip (clipper)": "King Philip was a 19th-century clipper ship launched in 1856 and wrecked in 1878. The wreck of this ship is only rarely visible; very infrequently the timbers can be seen protruding from the sands of Ocean Beach, on the Pacific Ocean coast of San Francisco, California. The wreck is the \"most complete remains of an American medium clipper.\" This is a shipwreck of one of many ships that were wrecked in and around San Francisco Bay."}}
