{"Burbank": {"Rancho Cahuenga": "Rancho Cahuenga was a 388-acre (1.57 km2) Mexican land grant in the San Fernando Valley, in present day Los Angeles County, California given in 1843 by governor Manuel Micheltorena to Jos\u00e9 Miguel Triunfo. Rancho Cahuenga is now a part of the city of Burbank, with the Los Angeles River channel running through it.  Rancho Cahuenga is often confused with the nearby Campo de Cahuenga, near what is now Universal City, where in 1847 the Articles of Capitulation were signed, ending the Mexican-American War in Alta California."}}
