{"Huntington_Park": {"Triforium (Los Angeles)": "Triforium is the name of a six-story, 60-ton public sculpture at Fletcher Bowron Square in the Los Angeles Mall Civic Center complex, located at the intersection of Temple and Main Streets in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Mall's architect, Robert Stockwell commissioned artist Joseph Young to create the sculpture and it was installed in 1975. Young's original plans called for a kinetic sculpture, which would use motion sensors and a computer controlled system to detect and translate the motions of passersby into patterns of light and sound displayed by the Venetian glass prisms and carillon."}}
