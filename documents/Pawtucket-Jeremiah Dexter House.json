{"Pawtucket": {"Jeremiah Dexter House": "The Jeremiah Dexter House is an historic colonial house at 957 North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a 1-1/2 story gambrel-roofed wood frame structure, built in 1754 for printer Jeremiah Dexter on farm land that was originally granted to his ancestor Gregory Dexter, a friend and printer for Roger Williams. It is five bays wide, with a large central chimney typical of the period, and is one of the few surviving colonial-era farmhouses in the city."}}
