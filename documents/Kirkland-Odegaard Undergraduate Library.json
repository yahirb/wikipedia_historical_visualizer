{"Kirkland": {"Odegaard Undergraduate Library": "The Charles E. Odegaard Undergraduate Library (OUGL) houses secondary stacks, a learning commons and on-campus technology resources for students, primarily undergraduates, of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. Named after the 19th president of the university, it opened in 1972, replacing the small undergraduate library previously located at Suzzallo Library. The library fronts the northwest corner of Red Square and provides access to the parking garage below the plaza, which was built simultaneous with the library building."}}
