{"Camden": {"Franklin Square (Philadelphia)": "Franklin Square is one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn when he laid out the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1682. It is located in the Center City area, between North 6th and 7th Streets, and between Race Street and the Vine Street Expressway (I-676).\nWilliam Penn included this piece of green space in his original city plan as one of five squares, although the park was slow to develop because it was a marshy land."}}
