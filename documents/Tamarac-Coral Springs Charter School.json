{"Tamarac": {"Coral Springs Charter School": "Coral Springs Charter School was established in 1999 in Coral Springs, Florida. The school was originally constructed in 1977 as an enclosed mall. When the mall failed, the nearly vacant structure was purchased by Charter Schools USA and converted into a combination school, serving students in grades 6 through 12."}}
