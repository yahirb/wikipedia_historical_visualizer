{"Irving": {"University of Dallas School of Ministry": "The University of Dallas School of Ministry began in 1987 as the Institute for Religious and Pastoral Studies (IRPS), offering master's degrees in theological studies (MTS) and religious education (MRE). The founders of the School of Ministry envisaged an institute dedicated to training ministers who could respond to pastoral needs in their local Church communities. As such, the School has adopted a \u201cpractitioner\u201d model program so as to integrate preparation for practical ministry with study of the more abstract elements of theology. IRPS was renamed the School of Ministry in April, 2007.\nThe University of Dallas School of Ministry is one of the few Catholic universities in the U.S. that offer a comprehensive, four-year Catholic Biblical School (CBS) certification program. This program, which covers every book of the Bible, is also offered online and in both English and Spanish. The CBS is the largest program of its kind among all Catholic universities in the U.S. based on 2007 enrollment numbers.\nThe School of Ministry offers the nation\u2019s only Rome study program that is fully integrated into its master's degree programs. Courses are taught at the University\u2019s campus in Rome by members of the School\u2019s faculty and other top theological scholars.\nThe University of Dallas\u2019 School of Ministry is the only Catholic school in the country to offer its entire Master of Theological Studies degree program and CBS program online, as well as selected courses in its other master's degree programs."}}
