{"Omaha": {"Bohemian Cafe": "The Bohemian Cafe was located at 1406 South 13th Street in the historic Little Bohemia neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska. Established in 1924, the cafe sat next to the Prague Hotel. Employees dressed in traditional Czech outfits since its early years, and a small cocktail lounge called the Bohemian Girl is adjoined to the restaurant; the interior decoration, similar to the rest of the building, includes hand-painted folk-art pictures."}}
