{"Vancouver": {"Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District": "The Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District includes a wide variety of buildings erected by the Hudson's Bay Company, U.S. Army and the National Park Service at Fort Vancouver, Vancouver, Washington. The district includes reconstructions of historic buildings that were excluded from previously-designated historic districts on the grounds that they had no intrinsic history. Structures within the district include the reconstructed Fort Vancouver, Army buildings from the 1940s, and Mission 66-era Park Service facilities."}}
