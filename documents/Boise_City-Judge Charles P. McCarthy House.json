{"Boise_City": {"Judge Charles P. McCarthy House": "The Judge Charles P. McCarthy House is a two-story Prairie school duplex which was constructed in Boise, Idaho in 1913. It was apparently adapted from a Frank Lloyd Wright design published in the Ladies Home Journal in 1907. It appears basically as a two-story cube with a flat slab roof."}}
