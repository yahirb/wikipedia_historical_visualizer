{"Quincy": {"Weymouth Back River": "The Weymouth Back River, sometimes called Back River, is a short, primarily tidal river in Hingham and Weymouth, Massachusetts, about 10 miles (16 km) south of Boston. It arises from a number of tributaries in ponds and swamps, most notably Whitmans Pond, flows northward, and empties into Hingham Bay (just south of Grape Island and Slate Island).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe river formed as the last glacier retreated from New England about 12,000 years ago, when glacial melting increased the sea level and low \u2013 lying coastal areas were flooded."}}
