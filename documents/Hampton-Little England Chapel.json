{"Hampton": {"Little England Chapel": "Little England Chapel (originally called The Ocean Cottage Sunday School) was founded by George C. Rowe. Mr. Rowe, a printer at Hampton Institute, began the Sunday School with three Newtown children, in a small section of his home. The Sunday School became so popular that they needed more space to hold the Bible sessions."}}
