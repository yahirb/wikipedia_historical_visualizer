{"Stamford": {"St. Agnes Church (Greenwich, Connecticut)": "St. Agnes is a Roman Catholic parish church in Greenwich, Connecticut, part of the Diocese of Bridgeport. The church architecture is notable as an example of the adaptive reuse of an early twentieth-century estate carriage house; it has been substantially renovated over the years for more serviceable ecclesiastical means."}}
