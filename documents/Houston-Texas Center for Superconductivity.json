{"Houston": {"Texas Center for Superconductivity": "The Texas Center for Superconductivity (TcSUH) is a research center based at the University of Houston with main focus on superconductivity and materials research, aiming to develop high temperature superconducting materials (HTS). Scientists and engineers from the chemistry and physics department as well as from chemical, electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering work together closely to gain fundamental understanding of HTS. The TcSUH-facilities comprises more than the area of a football field, distributed over 3 buildings and containing equipment to fabricate and analyse superconductor materials and compound semiconductors, etc.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe TcSUH consists of three research divisions:\nThe division Superconductivity and Related Materials focuses on fundamental properties of High-temperature superconductivity which includes biomedical and other applications."}}
