{"Portland": {"Deering Estate Barn": "The Deering Estate Barn was an architecturally significant building in the campus of the University of Maine at Portland, now the University of Southern Maine (USM), in Portland, Maine. Built about 1805 (along with a mansion) to a design by Alexander Parris, it was remodeled to plans by John Calvin Stevens II when the estate was taken over by Portland Junior College in 1947. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1969, and demolished that same month over the protests of the university community."}}
