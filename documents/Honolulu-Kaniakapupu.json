{"Honolulu": {"Kaniakapupu": "Kaniakap\u016bp\u016b (\"the singing of the land shells\"), known formerly as Luakaha (\"place of relaxation\"), is the ruins of the former summer palace of King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Built in the 1840s, and situated in the cool uplands of the Nu\u02bbuanu Valley, it served as the king and queen's summer retreat after the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii moved from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845. It was famous for being the site of a grand luau attended by an estimated ten thousand guests during the 1847 Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day celebration."}}
