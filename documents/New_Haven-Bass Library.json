{"New_Haven": {"Bass Library": "The Anne T. & Robert M. Bass Library, formerly Cross Campus Library, is a Yale University Library building holding frequently-used materials in the humanities and social sciences. Located underneath Yale University's Cross Campus, it was completed in 1971 in a minimalist-functionalist style designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. In 2007, Thomas Beeby led a multimillion-dollar renovation of the library that extensively reconfigured and refurbished its interior space."}}
