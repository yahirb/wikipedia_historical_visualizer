{"Sandy_Springs": {"Akers Mill": "Akers Mill, was a complex of at least two 19th-century mills along Rottenwood Creek in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. The gristmill built into the bank overlooking the creek, with six terraces each acting as an individual floor in the mill operation. The mills developed shortly before the Civil War, were sold to the Akers family in 1873 and in turn were utilized for the production of flour and meal for their Atlanta area grocery stores."}}
