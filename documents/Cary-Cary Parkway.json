{"Cary": {"Cary Parkway": "Cary Parkway (SR 3977) is a major semi-circular route through Cary, North Carolina. The parkway serves approximately as Cary's outer ring highway, though it does not form a complete circle like the inner ring, Maynard Road. Viewing a map of the city as a clock-face, Cary Parkway extends counterclockwise approximately from the 1 o'clock position in the northeast down to the 5 o'clock position in the southeast. At that point, the road departs from its circular path and heads southeast toward its terminus at Holly Springs Road."}}
