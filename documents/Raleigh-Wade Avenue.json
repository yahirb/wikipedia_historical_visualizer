{"Raleigh": {"Wade Avenue": "Wade Avenue (western segment also known as Raleigh-Chapel Hill Expressway or Wade Avenue Extension) is a major road in The Triangle region of North Carolina that links Interstate 40, Interstate 440 (Cliff Benson Beltline), and downtown Raleigh. The western segment of this road is a four-lane freeway and the eastern segment is an urban boulevard; I-440 beltway splits the segments. Wade Avenue provides a shortcut to North Raleigh for I-40 traffic (to and from Durham) via I-440; thus, along the west segment the eastbound direction is signed as TO I-440 and the westbound direction is signed as TO I-40."}}
