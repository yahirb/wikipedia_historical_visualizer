{"Portland": {"Awning (sculpture)": "Awning is an outdoor 1976 painted aluminum sculpture by Canadian artist Douglas Senft, located near Southwest 3rd Avenue and Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland, Oregon. The 60-foot (18 m) sculpture was selected and funded by the Portland Development Commission from more than 200 proposals in a request for art intended to \"humanize the modern architecture\" of the Portland Center. Senft was 26 years old when Awning was installed."}}
