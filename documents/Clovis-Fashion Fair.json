{"Clovis": {"Fashion Fair": "Fashion Fair is a medium-sized, enclosed shopping mall in Fresno, California, anchored by two Macy's stores, JCPenney, and Forever 21. Originally opened in 1970, Fashion Fair was expanded in 1983 (to accommodate Macy's and a new food court) and in 2005 (with the addition of an outdoor lifestyle wing). It competes with two outdoor shopping centers in Fresno: The Shops at River Park, three miles to the north; and Fig Garden Village, located 1.7 miles to the west."}}
