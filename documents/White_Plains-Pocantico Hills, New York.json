{"White_Plains": {"Pocantico Hills, New York": "Pocantico Hills is a hamlet in the Westchester County town of Mount Pleasant, New York, northeast of the village of Sleepy Hollow and southwest of the village of Pleasantville, in the United States. The area was originally settled by Native Americans of the Wecquaesgeek tribes; \"Pocantico\" means \"running between two hills\", and the name is a reference to the meandering Pocantico River. Nestled between the Hudson River on the west and the Saw Mill River Parkway on the east, one finds pristine woodlands, brooks, 1,000 acres (400 ha) of hiking trails, and nature walks an hour's drive from downtown Manhattan."}}
