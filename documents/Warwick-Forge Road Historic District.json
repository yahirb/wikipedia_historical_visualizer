{"Warwick": {"Forge Road Historic District": "The Forge Road Historic District is a historic district on Forge Road from Ives Road to the Potowomut River in Warwick, Rhode Island. Most of the district's nearly 200 acres (81 ha) are taken up by the Forge Farm, which lies south of Forge Road, is one of the oldest farms in Rhode Island (dating to the mid-17th century), and was the birthplace of American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. A memorial to Greene stands near the bridge crossing the Potowomut River."}}
