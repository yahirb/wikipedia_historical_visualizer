{"Jersey_City": {"90 West Street": "90 West Street (alternatively West Street Building) is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by architect Cass Gilbert and structural engineer Gunvald Aus for the West Street Improvement Corporation. When completed in 1907, the building's Gothic styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its 23-story height, and foreshadowed Gilbert's later work on the Woolworth Building."}}
