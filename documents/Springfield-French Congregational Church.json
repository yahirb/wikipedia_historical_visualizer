{"Springfield": {"French Congregational Church": "The French Congregational Church, known since 1919 as the First Spiritualist Church, is a historic High Victorian Gothic church at 33-37 Bliss Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The pressed brick church was built in 1887, under the sponsorship of Daniel B. Wesson, to provide a place of worship for French Huguenots employed by Smith & Wesson. With declining membership, the church was sold in 1909 and used for a time to house a variety of Congregationalist congregations."}}
