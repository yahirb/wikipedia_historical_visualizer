{"Rockford": {"Condon Brothers and R. H. Shumway Building": "The Condon Brothers and R. H. Shumway Building, located at 624-642 Cedar Street in Rockford, Illinois, is the historic headquarters of the Condon Brothers and R. H. Shumway seed companies. The building was built in 1912 for the Condon Brothers, a family-run company founded two years earlier. In 1933, the Condon Brothers merged with the R. H. Shumway Company; while the two firms still advertised separately, they both operated out of the Cedar Street building."}}
