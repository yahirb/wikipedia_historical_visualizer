{"Los_Angeles": {"The Downtown Independent": "The Downtown Independent is a theater and cinema located in the Little Tokyo area of Los Angeles, California. It is operated by the Downtown Independent and owned by Orange County, California's Cinema Properties Group. Closed since the mid-1980s, the former Linda Lea Theatre was originally the Arrow Theatre and later the Aztec in the 1920s and 1930s.\nIn April 2007, crews began construction on the site of the former Linda Lea theater at 251 South Main Street. The Downtown Independent is an ultra-modern one-screen movie house that shows independent films and holds special events ranging in genre from musical performances to rooftop fashion shows. In March the developer, Costa Mesa-based Cinema Properties Group, demolished all but the exterior walls of the rundown 1924 theater. Hodgetts + Fung Associates designed the sleek, glass and steel cube-shaped cinema which had its grand opening gala on December 1, 2007. The venue is slightly less than 10,000 square feet (930 m2) and has stadium seating for 222, a live performance space and a gorgeous rooftop with views of Downtown Los Angeles."}}
