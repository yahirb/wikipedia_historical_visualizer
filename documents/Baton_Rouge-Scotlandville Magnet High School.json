{"Baton_Rouge": {"Scotlandville Magnet High School": "Scotlandville Magnet High School (SMHS) is a public high school located on Louisiana Highway 19 (Scotland Avenue) in the Scotlandville area of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just northeast of the Southern University campus. Scotlandville High is part of the East Baton Rouge Parish Public Schools.\nScotlandville High is a magnet school and comprehensive campus. All magnet and engineering program honors students are housed in a different building from the community and Center of Excellence students. Its rival school is Mckinley High School.\nDuring a period from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, Scotlandville was a magnet only school that required a 2.5 GPA to stay in the school. It also housed the High School for the Engineering Professions, which required a 3.0 to stay in the program. Both of these requirements, and these programs, were cut in the late 1990s. During this period of time, there were no major athletics at the school (football, baseball and basketball), as the main focus was academic. When this change occurred, the school lost the majority of the staff and leadership of the school.\nAfter a nearly 10-year absence of the program, the school's varsity football team was re-instituted in the 2001-2002 school year. Scotlandville High competes in the highest athletic classification in the state which is 5A for all sports.\nThe school serves the Scotlandville neighborhood of Baton Rouge as well as a section of the Brownfields census-designated place."}}
