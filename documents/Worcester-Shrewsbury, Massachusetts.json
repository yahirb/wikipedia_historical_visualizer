Shrewsbury, unlike other surrounding towns like Grafton, Millbury, Westborough, and Northborough did not become a mill town or farming village, rather most of its 19th-century growth was due to its proximity to Worcester and visitors to Lake Quinsigamond. The population was 35,608 according to the 2010 US Census, in nearly 12,400 households."}}
