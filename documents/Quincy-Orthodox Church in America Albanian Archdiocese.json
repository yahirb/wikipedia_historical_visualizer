{"Quincy": {"Orthodox Church in America Albanian Archdiocese": "The Albanian Orthodox Archdiocese in America (Albanian: Kryedioqeza Orthodokse Shqiptare n\u00eb Amerik\u00eb) is one of three ethnic dioceses of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA). Its territory includes parishes, and missions located in seven states in the United States \u2013 California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe earliest organized Albanian dioceses were set up under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America (now Orthodox Church in America), because the Church of Constantinople would not allow the rise of any Albanian Orthodox Church and officially opposed the use of the Albanian language in churches until 1937 when the Autocephalic Orthodox Church of Albania was recognized by Constantinople."}}
