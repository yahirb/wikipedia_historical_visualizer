{"Honolulu": {"C.W. Dickey House": "The C.W. Dickey House at 3030 Kalakaua Avenue in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi, was one of the earliest residences designed by C.W. Dickey in his \"Hawaiian style\" after he resettled in the islands in 1925. He built it for himself and lived in it from 1926 until 1933, when he built himself a rather less humble dwelling at Makalei Place on the front slope of Diamond Head. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984."}}
