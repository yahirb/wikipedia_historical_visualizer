{"Inglewood": {"China Art Objects Galleries": "China Art Objects Galleries was a contemporary art gallery in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamed after a box sign that had been left behind by the space's previous tenant, China Art Objects was founded by a group of friends that included Peter Kim, Amy Yao, Mark Heffernan, Steve Hanson and Giovanni Intra. Shortly after its opening however, the gallery became mainly a project of critic Intra and musician/librarian Hanson (with Heffernan staying on as a silent partner)."}}
