{"Glendale": {"Hollywood Star Lanes": "Hollywood Star Lanes was a 32-lane bowling alley located on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Open from 1960 to 2002, the alley was featured in the movies The Big Lebowski and The Big Empty, which was filmed on location over three weeks of the eleven-week filming schedule. In 2002, the alley was closed after the Los Angeles Unified School District seized the land by eminent domain, with the goal of building an elementary school at the site."}}
