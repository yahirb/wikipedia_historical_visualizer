{"Houston": {"The Orange Show": "Jeff McKissack, a mail carrier in Houston, Texas, transformed a small suburban lot near his wood frame house into The Orange Show in honor of his favorite fruit. Between 1956 and 1980, when he died, McKissak used common building materials and recycled junk such as bricks, tiles, fencing, and farm implements to transform his home into an architectural maze of walkways, balconies, arenas and exhibits decorated with mosaics and brightly painted iron figures.\nWhen McKissack died, Houston arts patron Marilyn Oshman formed a non-profit foundation to preserve The Orange Show."}}
