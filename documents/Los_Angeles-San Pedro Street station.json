{"Los_Angeles": {"San Pedro Street station": "San Pedro Street is an at-grade light rail station on the Los Angeles County Metro Blue Line.\nIt has an island platform in the center median of Washington Boulevard near the intersection of San Pedro Street in South Los Angeles, California. As the name of the station implies, Metro usually names most of their stations after the nearest cross streets, so it is not named for the Los Angeles district of San Pedro, which is located farther south near the Pacific Ocean."}}
