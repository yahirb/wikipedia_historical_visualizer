{"Stamford": {"Noroton River": "The Noroton River is a 9.4-mile-long (15.1 km) stream flowing into Holly Pond and forming most of the border between Stamford and Darien, Connecticut, United States. The river's headwaters are in New Canaan, Connecticut. It is the largest flowing body of water between Mill River/Rippowam River to the west and Five Mile River to the east, although Stony Brook and the Goodwives River in Darien are not much smaller.\nPollution runoff from Interstate 95 flows down the Noroton River into Holly Pond. In 2009, the Stamford and Darien local governments asked the federal government for an $11.7 million grant (to fund 65 percent of an $18 million project) for \"dredging and ecosystem restoration\" in the pond and river, including \"construction of wetlands, bioswales and other restoration structures\".\nTwo restaurants are located at the mouth of the river, where U.S. Route 1 (known as the Boston Post Road on the Darien side and East Main Street on the Stamford side) crosses it. Both feature windows offering diners a view of the river. The restaurant on the north side is in Stamford. On the south side, the current Giovanni's II Steakhouse is the most recent business to occupy a lot where restaurants have been sited since the early 20th century."}}
