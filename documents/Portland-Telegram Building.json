{"Portland": {"Telegram Building": "The Telegram Building is a historic building in Portland, Oregon. It formerly served as the headquarters of The Evening Telegram, a now-defunct local newspaper founded in 1877 by Henry L. Pittock. A Republican-leaning newspaper, the Telegram merged in 1931 with the Portland News, creating the Portland News-Telegram, which in turn ceased publishing in 1939."}}
