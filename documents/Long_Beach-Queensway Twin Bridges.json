{"Long_Beach": {"Queensway Twin Bridges": "The Queensway Twin Bridges (sometimes Queens Way Bridges or Queensway Bay Bridge) connect downtown Long Beach with the outer Port of Long Beach. They are the southernmost crossing of the Los Angeles River, near the mouth of the river, where it empties into Queensway Bay, and they are the primary arterial link between Long Beach and RMS Queen Mary. The bridges were completed in June 1970 and opened on October 5, 1970."}}
