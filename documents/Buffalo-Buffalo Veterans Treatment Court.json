{"Buffalo": {"Buffalo Veterans Treatment Court": "The Buffalo Veterans Treatment Court is a judicial \"veterans' court\" which was first established in 2008 in Buffalo, New York, USA, as part of the Erie County court system. The court, which bills itself as a \"hybrid drug and mental health court\", is considered the first of its kind in American law services, and was established in order to provide a civil court which tries cases involving veterans of the United States Armed Forces, based upon the belief that a large proportion of veterans from present and past conflicts have experienced hardships which are unique to their former service in the military.\nThe current judge of the court is Justice Robert T. Russell."}}
