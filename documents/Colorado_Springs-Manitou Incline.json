{"Colorado_Springs": {"Manitou Incline": "The Manitou Springs Incline, also known as the Manitou Incline or simply the Incline, is a popular hiking trail rising above Manitou Springs, Colorado, near Colorado Springs. The trail is the remains of a former 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge funicular railway whose tracks washed out during a rock slide in 1990. The Incline is famous for its sweeping views and steep grade, with an average grade of 45% (24\u00b0) and as steep as 68% (34\u00b0) in places, making it a fitness challenge for locals in the Colorado Springs area."}}
