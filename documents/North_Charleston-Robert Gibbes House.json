{"North_Charleston": {"Robert Gibbes House": "The Robert Gibbes House in Charleston, South Carolina, was built in the Adamesque style at least by the time Robert Gibbes, Jr. was occupying it in 1819, perhaps earlier.\nThe land upon which the house was built, at the northwest corner of Elizabeth and John Streets, had belonged to William Wragg and passed to his heirs after Wragg died in 1796."}}
