{"Peoria": {"West Bluff Historic District": "The West Bluff Historic District is one of three Registered Historic Districts in the Peoria County, Illinois, city of Peoria. The district is mostly residential and is an example of the opulence once enjoyed by the upper class in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of particular note are two contributing structures designed by Frank Lloyd Wright: Francis W. Little House at 1505 W. Moss Ave., and the house at 1316 W. Moss Ave."}}
