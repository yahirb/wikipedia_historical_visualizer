{"Youngstown": {"Gateway Yard": "The Gateway Yard of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, located in Youngstown, Ohio, opened in the fall of 1957 and remained in operation until CSX took over the P&LE and closed the yard in 1993. Gateway served as a place to classify and sort freight cars as well as an interchange with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the New York Central Railroad. Most of the cars that entered the yard were destined for Youngstown's steel mills."}}
