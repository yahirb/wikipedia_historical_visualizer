{"Sparks": {"Washoe County Courthouse": "The Washoe County Courthouse, at 117 S. Virginia St. in Reno, Nevada, was built in 1910. It is significant for playing a role in the divorce industry in Nevada during the first half of the 20th century, when divorce was legal in Nevada and liberal residency requirements were enacted, while divorce was much more difficult elsewhere."}}
