{"Boulder": {"Walden Ponds Wildlife Habitat": "Walden Ponds Wildlife Habitat is a 102-acre (41 ha) Boulder County, Colorado park. It was reclaimed between 1974 and the 1990s from an open-pit gravel mine on the site, and is named after Walden \"Wally\" Toevs, the Boulder County Commissioner who spearheaded the plan to convert the gravel pits into a wildlife habitat.\nAfter the mining ceased and the property had been stripped 15 feet (4.6 m) down to bedrock, all that was left were open pits and puddles of ground water."}}
