Construction of the project, which is largely being funded by a 0.25% sales tax increase passed by Cuyahoga County commissioners in 2007, began in May 2011. As of February 2013, construction of the joint Medical Mart-Cleveland Convention Center is well underway on the historic Mall.The Medical Mart concept is modeled after that of the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and will be managed by MMPI, the same company that operates the Merchandise Mart.\nThe center is attached to the new Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel which is scheduled to open in 2016."}}
