{"Malden": {"Charlestown Neck": "The Charlestown Neck was an isthmus connecting the formerly independent city of Charlestown, Massachusetts to the mainland at present-day Sullivan Square in Middlesex County. When Charlestown was first settled by British colonists it was surrounded on nearly all sides by water. Only a small strip of land called \"the neck\" connected what is now Charlestown to what would become Somerville."}}
