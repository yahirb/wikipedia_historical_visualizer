{"Quincy": {"Home for Destitute Jewish Children": "The Home for Destitute Jewish Children is a historic orphanage at 150-156 American Legion Highway in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is a three-story Classical Revival brick structure, designed by John A. Hasty and built in 1911. Local Jewish congregations formed the Ladies Helping Hand Auxiliary of the Home for Jewish Children in 1908, which raised the funds to build the orphanage as a replacement for a smaller facility in Roxbury."}}
