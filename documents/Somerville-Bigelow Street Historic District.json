{"Somerville": {"Bigelow Street Historic District": "The Bigelow Street Historic District encompasses a uniform collection of 19th century houses on most of the length of Bigelow Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just northwest of Central Square. Bigelow Street was laid out in 1868, and the street was almost completely built out by 1874, resulting in a fairly uniform streetscape of Second Empire architecture. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982."}}
