{"Canton": {"John and Syd Dobkins House": "Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1953 and completed in 1954, the John and Syd Dobkins House is one of three Wright-designed Usonian houses in Canton, Ohio. Located farther east than the Nathan Rubin Residence and the Ellis A. Feiman House, it is set back from the road, has tall, thin casement windows and prominent doors that rise to nearly the roofline. Its distinctive geometric design module based upon an equilateral triangle reflects Wright's Usonian design philosophy."}}
