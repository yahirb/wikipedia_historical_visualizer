{"Sandy": {"Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal": "The Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal is an historic waterway in Salt Lake County, Utah. It was first envisioned in 1849 and construction began in 1855. Initially conceived as a way to transport granite blocks from a quarry in Little Cottonwood Canyon to the construction site of the future Salt Lake Temple (a railroad spur from the canyon to the temple grounds was completed before this could become a reality), the canal evolved into a typical irrigation waterway."}}
