{"Glendale": {"California Laundry": "California Laundry was an early 1920s business in Hollywood, California, and in its day, possibly the city's largest business institution outside of the film studios. It was located on Vine Street. At the time it was established, the California Laundray was one of the few laundry businesses in the country in which each machine was driven by an individual motor, eliminating the possibility of a breakdown which would cripple the entire plant."}}
