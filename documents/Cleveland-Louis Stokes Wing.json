{"Cleveland": {"Louis Stokes Wing": "The Louis Stokes Wing is a 1998-erected 163 foot 10-story high-rise addition to the main branch of the 15th largest public library in the country, Cleveland Public Library located in the Civic Center district of downtown Cleveland. So as not to detract from the original Group Plan Main Branch Library building, the Wing was designed to appear as if it were the reincarnation of what the library building would look like if it emerged as a modern updated structure from the classic age of architecture.  Nevertheless, the building dwarfs its much squatter Main Branch Building companion. The Stokes houses the special book storage collections, the audio visual archives (videos, DVDs, CDs, etc.), the children's collections, the circulation desk, and much more for the library system.\nThe building is named after the former US Congressman who served in Ohio's 11th congressional district from 1968-1998."}}
