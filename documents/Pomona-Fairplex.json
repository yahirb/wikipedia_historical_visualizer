{"Pomona": {"Fairplex": "Fairplex, formerly known as the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds prior to 1984, has been the home of the L.A. County Fair since 1922. It is located in the city of Pomona, California. The L.A. County Fair is now held during the month of September, but the facility is used year-round to host a variety of educational, commercial, and entertainment such as trade and consumer shows, conventions, and sporting events.\nFairplex is owned by the Los Angeles County, but is leased to and is governed by an independent, self-supporting non-profit organization, the Los Angeles County Fair Association, which manages and produces the county fair and re-invests surplus revenues generated by the fair and other events in the maintenance and development of the facility."}}
