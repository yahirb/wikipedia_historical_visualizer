{"West_Allis": {"Pettit National Ice Center": "The Pettit National Ice Center is an indoor ice skating facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, featuring two international-size ice rinks and a 400-meter speed skating oval. Located adjacent to Wisconsin State Fair Park, the center opened on January 1, 1993, and was named for Milwaukee philanthropists Jane and Lloyd Pettit. Although Wisconsin State Fair Park owns the land and the building, the Pettit National Ice Center Inc., a non-profit corporation, has operated the site since the facility opened."}}
