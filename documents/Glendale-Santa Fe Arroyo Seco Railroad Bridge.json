{"Glendale": {"Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge": "The Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge in Highland Park, Los Angeles, is more than 700 feet (210 m) long and crosses the Arroyo Seco Parkway at an elevation of over 100 feet (30 m). It the tallest and longest railroad span in the city of Los Angeles, and most likely the oldest such structure still in use. The bridge crosses the lower part of the Arroyo Seco, a watershed canyon from the San Gabriel Mountains."}}
