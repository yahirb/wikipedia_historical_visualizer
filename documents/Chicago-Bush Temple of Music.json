{"Chicago": {"Bush Temple of Music": "The Bush Temple of Music, at 100 West Chicago Avenue in Chicago, was built in 1901 as the headquarters and showroom of the Bush and Gerts Piano Company, one of Chicago\u2019s leading piano companies. Designed by architect J.E.O. Pridmore, the building is an example of the importance of piano manufacturing and sales during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Chicago was the leading piano manufacturing center in the world. The building is a rare large-scale example of French Renaissance Revival-style architecture, an unusual style in Chicago and the United States."}}
