{"Bellevue": {"Colman Park (Seattle)": "Colman Park is a 24.3-acre (98,000 m2) park in the Mount Baker neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, located just south of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge (Interstate 90) along Lake Washington and inland to 31st Avenue S.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1881 the Town Council authorized the first \"municipal\" water company which took over a maze of privately owned systems and was authorized to charge for water service.\nAppropriately named \"The Spring Hill Water Co.\", the needs of a growing town were served by building a pumping plant \"all the way over here\" on Lake Washington; the year was 1886 and the pump was steam operated. Failure of the main pump brought the designing engineers from the East, who were unable to find the difficulty."}}
