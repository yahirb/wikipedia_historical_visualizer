{"Los_Angeles": {"DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles Downtown": "The DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles Downtown is located in Los Angeles, California, USA. Managed by Rim Hospitality Inc., the hotel is located in the Little Tokyo area of downtown Los Angeles at 120 South Los Angeles Street.\nOpened in 1977, it was the New Otani Hotel & Garden for thirty years until a change of ownership in 2007, when it became the Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens. The hotel features 434 guest rooms on 21 floors with three restaurants: Garden Grill, Thousand Cranes, and the Azalea. Popular with Japanese tourists, the hotel is known for its half-acre rooftop garden inspired by an ancient garden in Japan. It is 19 miles (31 km) from Los Angeles International Airport, and 2 miles (3.2 km) from the Los Angeles Convention Center.\nFollowing bankruptcy proceedings, the Kyoto Grand was again rebranded as a DoubleTree by Hilton in July 2012, following renovations.\nIn 2011 electronic producer Skrillex named a song on his new EP Bangarang \"Kyoto\" because he produced the whole song on his notebook in one of the hotel rooms and even recorded the vocals there."}}
