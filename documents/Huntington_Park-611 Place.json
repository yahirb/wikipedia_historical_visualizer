{"Huntington_Park": {"611 Place": "611 Place is a 189 m (620 ft) skyscraper at 611 West 6th Street in Downtown Los Angeles, California, designed by William L. Pereira & Associates and completed in 1969. The building was commissioned by the now-defunct Crocker Citizen's Bank, and served as its Southern California headquarters until 1983, when it moved to Crocker Center, now Wells Fargo Center (Los Angeles). It was subsequently bought by AT&T. It was the tallest building in Los Angeles upon completion, and the first building to surpass Los Angeles City Hall in terms of structural height (many buildings had surpassed City Hall with decorative spires, the first being Richfield Tower)."}}
