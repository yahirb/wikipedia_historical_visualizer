{"Jonesboro": {"Berger House (Jonesboro, Arkansas)": "The Berger House is a historic house at 1120 South Main Street in Jonesboro, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick structure with a cross gable roof, and was built in 1896 by Morris Berger, one of Jonesboro's first Jewish businessmen. It is a fine example of the Queen Anne style in brick, although it has lost some details (notably its porch and decorative elements on its chimneys)."}}
