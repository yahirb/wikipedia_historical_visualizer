{"New_Brunswick": {"Busch Campus of Rutgers University": "Busch Campus is one of the five sub-campuses at Rutgers University's New Brunswick/Piscataway area campus, and is located entirely within Piscataway, New Jersey, US. Academic facilities and departments centered on this campus are primarily those related to the natural sciences: physics, pharmacy, engineering, psychology, mathematics and statistics, chemistry, geology, and biology. The Rutgers Medical School was also built on this campus in 1970, but a year later was separated by the state, renamed the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and merge with the New Jersey Medical School and other health profession schools in Newark and New Brunswick to create the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Rutgers and the medical school continued to share the land and facilities on the campus in a slightly irregular arrangement."}}
