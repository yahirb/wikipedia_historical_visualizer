{"Mesa": {"Tri City Mall": "Tri-City Mall was a mall located in Mesa, Arizona, at the northeast corner of Main Street and Dobson Road. It was opened in 1968 and was the first enclosed shopping center in the East Valley region of the Phoenix metropolitan area. It was named Tri-City because it was intended to draw shoppers from three East Valley cities: Mesa, Tempe and Chandler."}}
