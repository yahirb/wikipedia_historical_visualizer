{"New_Orleans": {"Orleans Parish School Board": "New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) is the public school system that serves all of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Schools within the system are governed by a multitude of entities, including the Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB), which directly administers 6 schools and has granted charters to another 18, and the Recovery School District of Louisiana (RSD), which no longer directly administers any schools within Orleans Parish. Instead, all public schools operating under the RSD umbrella within Orleans Parish are, as of the Fall of 2014, independent public charter schools."}}
