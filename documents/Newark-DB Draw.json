{"Newark": {"DB Draw": "DB Draw is a railroad swing bridge crossing the Hackensack River between Secaucus and Kearny, in New Jersey, United States. It was built in 1889 by the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, (reorganized in 1895 as the Erie Railroad) and was used by the New York and Greenwood Lake and the Newark Branch\nThe bridge later carried New Jersey Transit's Boonton Line until the line was connected to the Montclair Branch via the Montclair Connection, to form the Montclair-Boonton Line. The bridge then reverted to Norfolk Southern Railway control, which has since placed it out of service."}}
