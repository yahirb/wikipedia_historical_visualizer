{"Santa_Clara": {"The Grizzly": "The Grizzly is a wooden roller coaster located at California's Great America in Santa Clara, California. The ride was designed by Curtis D. Summers and manufactured by Kings Island Construction. It uses traditional tracks with steel wheels on the cars, and, therefore, is designed to maintain positive-g loading on the cars and riders throughout its course."}}
