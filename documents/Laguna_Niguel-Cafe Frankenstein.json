{"Laguna_Niguel": {"Cafe Frankenstein": "The Caf\u00e9 Frankenstein was a coffee house in Laguna Beach, California, United States.\nFrom 1958-62, the Caf\u00e9 Frankenstein was seen as sort of a \"den of iniquity\" amongst the semi-conservative Orange County, California art community of Laguna Beach. Located at 860 South Pacific Coast Highway, Cafe Frankenstein boasted a steady diet of beats, surfers, folkies, teens and all manner of weirdos, and was suspected of harboring drugs and other debauchery."}}
