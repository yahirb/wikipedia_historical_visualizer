{"Charleston": {"Summers House": "The Summers House is a historic house located at 805 Loudon Heights Road in Charleston, West Virginia. Elizabeth and Okey Summers had the house built circa 1939; Elizabeth was active in theater, while Okey was a prominent local banker. The house was part of Charleston's upper-class South Hills neighborhood, and its site was a former stone quarry that was solid rock prior to the house's construction; the sandstone from the quarry was used as the house's building material."}}
