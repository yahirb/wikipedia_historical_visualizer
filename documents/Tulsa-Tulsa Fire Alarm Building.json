{"Tulsa": {"Tulsa Fire Alarm Building": "The Tulsa Fire Alarm Building is a historic Art Deco building at 1010 East Eighth Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was built in 1931 and served as the central reporting station for the Tulsa Fire Department. Fires were reported from alarm boxes spread around town to this building and the firemen in this building would alert the fire station closest to the fire. At the time of its construction this system was the best available alarm system. The building is just east of the Inner Dispersal Loop in Tulsa's Pearl District."}}
