{"Providence": {"Ernest Street Sewage Pumping Station": "The Ernest Street Sewage Pumping Station is an historic wastewater pumping station at Ernest and Ellis Streets near the wastewater treatment facility at Field's Point in Providence, Rhode Island. The surviving elements of the station include a main pumphouse and a smaller screening house, both built in 1897-98 as part of a major effort to modernize Providence's sewage treatment facilities. A third structure, a boiler house, was demolished in 1987, and a tall smokestack was taken down in the 1930s."}}
