{"Fayetteville": {"Son's Chapel": "Son's Chapel is a historic church at 5480 East Mission in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a single-story rustic fieldstone structure, with front-gable roof and a squat square tower set off to one side. Built between 1933 and 1937, the building is an interesting and unusual mix of Gothic and Romanesque styles, with windows set under Romanesque arches, and the tower with a crenellated parapet."}}
