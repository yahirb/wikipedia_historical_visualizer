{"Conway": {"Frank U. Halter House": "The Frank U. Halter House is a historic house at 1355 College Avenue in Conway, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a complex gable-and-hip roof characteristic of the Queen Anne style. Also typical of that style are its wraparound porch with spindled woodwork, a turreted corner pavilion, and bargeboard in some of the gable ends."}}
