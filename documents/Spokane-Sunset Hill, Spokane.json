{"Spokane": {"Sunset Hill, Spokane": "Sunset Hill is a neighborhood located west of downtown Spokane, Washington, and just east of the West Plains. Sunset Hill is a region with a mixture of poorly zoned areas, subdivisions, and old neighborhoods. Aside from being split in half by I-90 and the Sunset Highway, Sunset Hill sees little traffic due to the lack of thru-streets and limited exits to arterial roads."}}
