{"Franklin": {"Coats-Hines Site": "The Coats-Hines site is an archaeological site located in Williamson County, Tennessee in the Southeastern United States. The site is significant in that it is one of only a very few sites in Eastern North America that contains direct evidence of Paleoindian hunting of late Pleistocene proboscideans. Excavations at the site have yielded portions of four mastodon skeletons, including one in direct association with Paleoindian stone tools."}}
