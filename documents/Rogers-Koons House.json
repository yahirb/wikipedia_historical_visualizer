{"Rogers": {"Koons House": "The Koons House is a historic house at 409 Fifth Street NW in Bentonville, Arkansas. It is an unusually high-quality and well-preserved example of a once-common local vernacular form called the \"gumdrop duple\", a two-family residence with a pyramidal roof. The front facade has a single-story hip-roofed porch supported by tapered square columns, and there is a shed-roof addition across the rear."}}
