{"Cleveland": {"Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel": "The Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel (HCDH) is a skyscraper on the corner of Ontario Street and Lakeside Avenue along The Mall in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It opened in 2016, has 600 rooms and stands 32 stories in height. It is one of four Hilton properties in downtown Cleveland, the other three being Hilton Garden Inn, the DoubleTree Hotel Cleveland, and Hampton Inn.\nThe building was constructed under a partnership between the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County for the purposes of attracting larger conventions to the city of Cleveland. The agreement was entered into under the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, Ed FitzGerald's administration and the three-term Cleveland mayor Frank G. Jackson.\nThe hotel is the tallest and largest in the city. Previously, the largest hotel in the city was the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel which has 500 rooms. This is the first major hotel constructed in the city since the building of the Marriott at Key Center in 1991 at a height of 320 feet with 385 rooms. The new Hilton is managed by Teri Agosta.."}}
