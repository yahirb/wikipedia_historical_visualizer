{"Manchester": {"Smyth Tower": "The Smyth Tower is a folly located on the grounds of the Manchester VA Medical Center at 718 Smyth Road in Manchester, New Hampshire. The fieldstone tower was built in 1888 by Frederick Smyth, who owned an extensive estate, part of which became the VA facility. Smyth built it as a replica of a tower he saw while visiting Scotland."}}
