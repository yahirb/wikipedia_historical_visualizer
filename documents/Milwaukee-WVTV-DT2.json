{"Milwaukee": {"WVTV-DT2": "WVTV-DT2, virtual channel 24.1 (UHF digital channel 18.2), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, which formerly held the call letters WCGV-TV as a separately-licensed full-power station. WVTV-DT2 is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and operates as a second digital subchannel of CW affiliate WVTV (channel 18), which began to host it as of January 8, 2018 after Sinclair sold the former WCGV spectrum in the 2016 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) incentive auction. WVTV-DT2 continues to utilize the separate branding of \"My 24\" from when it was a separate full-power station, along with its channel 24 designation."}}
