{"Doral": {"Miami International Mall": "Miami International Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Doral, Florida in southwestern Metropolitan Miami, and so named because it is close to Miami International Airport and is only a half mile from the larger outlet mall, Dolphin Mall. Like Coral Square, it was built by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. in 1983, and is currently owned and managed by Simon Property Group."}}
