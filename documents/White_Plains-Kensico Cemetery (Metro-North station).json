{"White_Plains": {"Kensico Cemetery (Metro-North station)": "Kensico Cemetery was a station on the Harlem Line of the Metro-North Railroad which served the large cemetery of the same name which the line runs through. Located along the platform behind the buildings at Sharon Gardens, the station was similar to the still-existent and nearby Mount Pleasant station in which it served friends and family of those buried there instead of actual commuters. By the late 1970s the station saw only three trains a day on weekends, and was a flag stop for one train on weekdays."}}
