{"Stamford": {"St. Mary's Church (Stamford, Connecticut)": "St. Mary's is a cathedral-style church located at 540 Elm Street in Stamford, Connecticut. The church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport. The main building is a Gothic Revival structure, designed by Francis L. S. Mayers and completed about 1928. It is an elegant example of French Gothic architecture, notable for the large rose window in the front-facing gable end. The rectory is a c. 1860 Italianate villa, originally built for a member of the locally prominent Wardwell family.\nThe complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987."}}
