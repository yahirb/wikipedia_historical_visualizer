{"New_Orleans": {"Orleans Tower": "Orleans Tower (formerly Amoco Building), located at 1340 Poydras Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a 20-story, 280 feet (85 m)-tall skyscraper designed in the international style by 3D/International. The international style grew in popularity during the sixties and seventies after the world-renowned architect Mies Van Der Rohe designed the Seagram Building on Park Ave in New York City and Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the Sears Tower in the heart of downtown Chicago. The building is primarily used for leaseable office space, with some retail space on the ground level."}}
