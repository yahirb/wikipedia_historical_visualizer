{"Knoxville": {"Fort Adair": "Fort Adair (sometimes called Adair's Station) was a stockade fortification that served as a supply depot for early settlers migrating west. The structure was constructed in 1788 or around 1791 at Grassy Valley, an early European settlement in the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley region of East Tennessee. The presence of a supply station encouraged more Europeans to settle in the vicinity."}}
