{"Rochester": {"Harts Local Grocers": "Hart's Local Grocers Hart\u2019s East End LLC is an independent grocery store managed by Rochester Local Capital LLC. It is located in the East End Neighborhood in Rochester, NY.\n\n\n== History and Store Description ==\nThe store was named after Hart's Groceries, which had over 100 locations in and around the city Rochester, NY by the 1920s. They were considered one of the first grocer to use store-brand labels and were also the first self-service grocery market. Hart's has attracted considerable interest in Downtown Rochester since its opening was announced in January 2014, primarily because downtown Rochester has not had a full-services grocery since the closing of Midtown Market formerly Wegmans Midtown in 2002."}}
