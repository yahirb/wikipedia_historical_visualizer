{"Green_Bay": {"Baird Law Office": "The Baird Law Office in Green Bay, Wisconsin was built in the 1830s in Greek Revival style, which was then popular as one of America's first architectural styles that explicitly rejected British practices. The small one-story building measures just 16 x 30 feet (9.1 m) in size and served historically as a professional building.\nA plaque from 1964 explains that it was built as a law office for Henry S. Baird (\"Father of the Wisconsin Bar\") in the early 1830s, then later used as a residence, and it was restored and moved to its then-current site in 1960."}}
