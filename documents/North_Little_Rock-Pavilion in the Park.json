{"North_Little_Rock": {"Pavilion in the Park": "Pavilion in the Park is an upscale shopping center in the northern part of Little Rock, Arkansas, along western Cantrell Road. Built in 1985 in the style of a European enclosed shopping area, the shopping center is notable as much for its upscale content as for many such retailers being locally owned and operated. Some tenants carry a long legacy in the city, such as Bauman's Men's Store, which opened downtown in 1919, and Trio's Restaurant, which has menu influences from the former Sam Peck Hotel, another one-time downtown fixture."}}
