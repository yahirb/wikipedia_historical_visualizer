{"Council_Bluffs": {"Scriptown": "Scriptown was the name of the first subdivision in the history of Omaha, which at the time was located in Nebraska Territory. It was called \"Scriptown\" because scrip was used as payment, similar to how a company would pay employees when regular money was unavailable. Its original survey placed the location from the Missouri River to North 30th Street, Cuming to Fort Street."}}
