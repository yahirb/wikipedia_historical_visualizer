{"Yonkers": {"University Heights Bridge": "The University Heights Bridge crosses the Harlem River, connecting West 207th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan to West Fordham Road in the University Heights section of the Bronx. The steel-truss revolving swing bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation and carries two lanes of traffic in each direction, along with a sidewalk on the south side of the bridge. It may have once carried the now-decommissioned New York State Route 9X.\nThe bridge has three masonry piers, and the approach spans are made of steel."}}
