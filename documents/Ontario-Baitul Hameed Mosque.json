Initially built in 1989 at a cost of $2.5 million, entirely from donations of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, it is located east of Los Angeles in Chino, California, just inside San Bernardino County. The San Gabriel Mountains provide a beautiful backdrop to this Spanish-inspired mosque with modern amenities."}}
