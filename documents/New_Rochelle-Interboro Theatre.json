{"New_Rochelle": {"Interboro Theatre": "Interboro Theatre was built in the 1920s and originally called the Interborough for a rapid transit route expansion that never came to pass. It was at 3462 East Tremont Avenue between Barkley Boulevard and Eastern Boulevard, now Bruckner, in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx, New York. The first movie shown was Seventh Heaven in 1927."}}
