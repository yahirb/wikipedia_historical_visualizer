{"Cleveland": {"Skylight Office Tower": "The Skylight Office Tower is a 1991-built 12 story 165 foot high-rise office building on the property of Tower City Center in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Like its closely resembled (though not perfect matching) sister building (Chase Financial Plaza) across the under street level concourse in Tower City's The Avenue, Skylight is postmodern in design and rests on a concrete slab that was left over from an unbuilt office tower in the 1930s that extends underneath the foundations of both the towers. The Skylight contains 321, 0000 square feet of office space and is known for its ornate grand lobby that features imported Italian granite, black marble, and mahogany detailing. The Skylight was constructed by RTKL, just like its sister building and was built at a time when Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland sought to increase the floor space and leasing opportunities for their considerable holdings in downtown."}}
