{"Rogers": {"Lillard-Sprague House": "The Lillard-Sprague House is a historic house on Pleasant Grove Street in Rogers, Arkansas. Built in 1907, it is a high-quality wood-frame example of a prow house, a local style with T-shaped layout where the stem of the T projects forward. In this instance, the projecting section is surrounded by a single-story wraparound porch, supported by Tuscan columns on stone piers."}}
