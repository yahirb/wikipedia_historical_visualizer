{"Jersey_City": {"Maccarone art gallery": "Maccarone is a contemporary art gallery that has two exhibition spaces in the West Village of New York City, along with a gallery space in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles.\nFounded in 2001 by Michele Maccarone, the gallery opened in an abandoned electronics store at 45 Canal Street. The gallery was among the first to exhibit in Chinatown, and the space allowed for the mounting of several projects historic in scope and unique to the space, including young artists alongside historic figures."}}
