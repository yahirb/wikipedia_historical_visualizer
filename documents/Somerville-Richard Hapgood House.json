{"Somerville": {"Richard Hapgood House": "The Richard Hapgood House is an historic multiunit house at 382-392 Harvard Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The six-unit wood frame building was built in 1889, and represents an unusual instance of Queen Anne styling applied to such a large structure. It was built at a time when housing stock was transitioning from small types of multiunit housing (row houses and two- or four-family dwellings) to larger formats such as tenements and apartment houses."}}
