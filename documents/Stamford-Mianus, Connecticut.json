{"Stamford": {"Mianus, Connecticut": "Mianus , formerly Mayamus and Upper Landing, is a neighborhood in the town of Greenwich in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Unlike other Greenwich neighborhoods such as Cos Cob or Old Greenwich, Mianus does not have its own ZIP code or post office. Mianus lies partly in the Cos Cob ZIP code, partly in the Riverside ZIP code area, and partly in the Old Greenwich ZIP code area. It lies at an elevation of 23 feet (7 m) and is home to an elementary school. Mianus was also home to the Mianus Motor Works, a marine-engine manufacturer.\nThe Mianus Village neighborhood is located north of the dammed section of the Mianus River at East Putnam Avenue (U.S. Route 1, also known as the Post Road). The dam separates the tidal salt water estuary from the fresh water river. The area above the dam is called Mianus Pond.\nThe Veterans Administration and the town of Greenwich, CT developed the village of 40 starter houses\u2014approximately 800 square feet each\u2014after World War II as rental units for returning servicemen and their families. In the 1950s, as many as 90 children lived with their parents in these houses. The nearby Mianus River, Cos Cob harbor and an extensive woods provided the children with an opportunity to live, grow and play in natural habitats rarely found in American public housing projects. Jack T. Scully, who spent the first 18 years of his life here, has written a collection of coming-of-age poems, Mianus Village, celebrating its bygone way of life.\nThe area and the river are named after the chief of the Siwanoy Tribe of Native Americans that inhabited the area when Europeans first encountered them. The Siwanoys sold areas of what is now called \"Old Greenwich\" to the first English settlers of the town for \"40 English Coates\" in 1640."}}
