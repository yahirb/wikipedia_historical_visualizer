{"Tallahassee": {"Jerry Michael Williams homicide": "Jerry Michael Williams (born October 16, 1969), known as Michael or Mike Williams to his friends and family, went missing on December 16, 2000 when it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After the subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned, but, in the years since then, later investigators came to suspect he was the victim of foul play, possibly at another location. His body was found in December 2017."}}
