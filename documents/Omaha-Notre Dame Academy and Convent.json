{"Omaha": {"Notre Dame Academy and Convent": "The Notre Dame Academy and Convent is located at 3501 State Street in the Florence neighborhood on the north end of Omaha, Nebraska. It is significant for its ethnic association with the Czech population in Nebraska as the only school and convent of the Czechoslovakian School Sisters de Notre Dame (this is not the same order as the School Sisters of Notre Dame) in the United States. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."}}
