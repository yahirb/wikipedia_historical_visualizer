{"Tulsa": {"McBirney Mansion (Tulsa, Oklahoma)": "The McBirney Mansion in Tulsa, Oklahoma was the home of James H. McBirney, co-founder of the Bank of Commerce in Tulsa in 1904. He was the original owner of the mansion, built by architect John Long in 1928, and lived there until 1976. The mansion contained 15,900 square feet (1,480 m2) and sits on a 2.91 acres (11,800 m2) lot. The mansion was bought by Donna and Roger Hardesty who lived there for 5 years. Eventually it was bought by a law firm that turned it into a law office. By 2007, was purchased by former American Airlines President George Warde, who had plans to transform it into a boutique hotel. In the meantime, the McBirney Mansion was used as an event center. Warde died in 2012, and events stopped being held at McBirney. By February 2012, the Pauls Corporation, a Denver real estate management company, acquired the mansion as part of the suit\u2019s settlement. Tulsa attorney, Gentner Drummond, bought the mansion from Pauls Corp. in 2014, announcing his intention to make it his family's home."}}
