{"Bellevue": {"Lake People Park": "Lake People Park is a 1\u20442-acre (0.20 ha) park at 3070 S. Bradford Street in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, just south of the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. and Rainier Avenue S. In 2003, the land was donated to the Seattle Parks Foundation by Monte Powell, a developer who was responsible for much of the newer construction in the neighborhood. He decided to make the donation after attending a presentation on community-established parks."}}
