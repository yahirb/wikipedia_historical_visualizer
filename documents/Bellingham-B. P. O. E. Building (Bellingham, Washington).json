{"Bellingham": {"B. P. O. E. Building (Bellingham, Washington)": "The B. P. O. E. Building, otherwise known as the Elks Club was originally built for the Bellingham chapter of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in 1912, during the city's second major building boom. It is located within the vicinity of the old Federal Building on Cornwall Avenue, historically known as Dock Street. The Elks no longer occupy the building and it is now home to an Italian restaurant."}}
