{"Portland": {"Trump Free Speech Rally": "The Trump Free Speech Rally was a demonstration organized by Patriot Prayer on June 4, 2017, in Portland, Oregon, in support of President Donald Trump. Several hundreds participants gathered, along with a larger group of counter-protesters who organized the Portland Stands United Against Hate Rally outside City Hall. Police worked to keep the groups separate, and closed neighboring Chapman Square where anti-fascist demonstrators had gathered."}}
