{"Trenton": {"Old Masonic Temple (Trenton, New Jersey)": "The Old Masonic Temple in Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey, United States, is a historic building built in 1793 at the corner of Front and Willow (or Barrack) streets near the New Jersey State House, and across the street from the Old Barracks. In 1915 when a new building was constructed for the Trenton Lodge, the old building was moved half a block south to 102 Barrack Street. It has served as a Masonic Lodge, a school, a shop for a furnisher and upholsterer, a museum, and is now a tourist information center."}}
