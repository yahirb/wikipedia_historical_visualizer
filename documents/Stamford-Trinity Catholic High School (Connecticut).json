{"Stamford": {"Trinity Catholic High School (Connecticut)": "Trinity Catholic High School is a regional, coeducational Catholic school for grades 9-12 located in Stamford, Connecticut. It serves parts of Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York. The school is a member of the FCIAC athletic conference. Trinity Catholic is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc. and the Connecticut Department of Education. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport.\nThe school is situated on a 26-acre (110,000 m2) campus at 926 Newfield Avenue. The school had an initial capacity of approximately 1,200 students, however, due to cost concerns and the demand for smaller student to faculty ratios, has since reduced its enrollment in order to set itself apart from other schools. It was originally known as Stamford Catholic High School, but after other local Catholic Schools closed, was grouped with remaining students to create Trinity Catholic High School."}}
