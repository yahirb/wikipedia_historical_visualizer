{"Fort_Collins": {"LaPorte Church of Christ": "LaPorte Church of Christ is an independent church in Laporte, Colorado, led until 2011 by Pastor Peter J. Peters (November 13, 1946 \u2013 July 7, 2011), who proclaimed that Europeans comprise the twelve lost tribes of Israel and that contemporary Jews are satanic impostors (based on Revelation 2:9 and 3:9) and the descendants of the Biblical Esau (Edom) -- the brother and nemesis of Jacob (Israel). Critics labeled his message to be that of Christian Identity, although he rejected this label. Peters and his church are no longer associated with the decentralized group of churches that use the name \"Churches of Christ\"."}}
