{"New_Bedford": {"Howland Mill Village Historic District": "The Howland Mill Village Historic District is a historic district roughly bounded by Bolton, Winsper, Hemlock Sts., and Rockdale Avenue in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It consists of a collection of single-family mill worker housing units constructed in 1888-89 for workers at the nearby Howland Mill, and several double-decker houses built in the 1920s. The districts uniformity of style is apparent despite some exterior alterations: there are only two basic house plans."}}
