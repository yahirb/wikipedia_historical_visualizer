{"Shoreline": {"NE 130th Street station": "NE 130th Street is a proposed station on Sound Transit's Lynnwood Link Extension, part of the Link Light Rail system, to be located in Seattle, Washington. The station, which would have served the Haller Lake and Pinehurst neighborhoods of northern Seattle, was deferred from the plans for Lynnwood Link during the Sound Transit Board's selection of the final route for the line on April 23, 2015. Instead, a provision for future accommodation for construction of a station at NE 130th Street without impacting service was included in the board's resolution, at a cost of $10 million."}}
