{"Pittsburgh": {"Siege of Fort Pitt": "For the 1885 action in the Canadian North-West Rebellion, see the Battle of Fort Pitt\n\nThe Siege of Fort Pitt took place during June and July 1763 in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The siege was a part of Pontiac's War, an effort by Native Americans to remove the British from the Ohio Country and Allegheny Plateau after they refused to honor their promises and treaties to leave voluntarily after the defeat of the French. The Native American efforts of diplomacy, and by siege, to remove the British from Fort Pitt ultimately failed."}}
