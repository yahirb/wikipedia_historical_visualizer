{"Stamford": {"Methodist Episcopal Church (Greenwich, Connecticut)": "The Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic church and parsonage at 61 East Putnam Avenue (United States Route 1) in Greenwich, Connecticut. The church building is a single-story Carpenter Gothic structure, built in 1868-69 for a Methodist congregation established in 1805. The adjacent parsonage, now a community center, is a vernacular Italianate house built in 1872, and has a large modern two-story brick addition at the rear. The church was designed to resemble an English Gothic country church, but now occupies a site surrounded by commercial development.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988."}}
