{"Somerville": {"Ware Hall": "Ware Hall is an historic residential apartment building at 383 Harvard Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built in 1893, this five story brick Classical Revival building is a rare example of an apartment house built in Mid Cambridge that was designed to cater to Harvard University students. Apartment blocks of this quality were generally built closer to the Harvard campus, so this one stands out when compared to other apartment house in its immediate surroundings."}}
