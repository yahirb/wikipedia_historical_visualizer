{"Passaic": {"Anderson Street Bridge (Hackensack River)": "The Anderson Street Bridge, also known as the Cedar Lane Bridge, is a fixed-span road bridge over the Hackensack River in Hackensack and Teaneck in Bergen County, New Jersey, U.S. The crossing was built in 1971 to replace an earlier structure. Being structurally deficient, the bridge was given weight restrictions in 2012 and was partially closed in 2016 for interim repairs. It is one of several bridges over the river in Hackensack, including the Court Street Bridge, the Midtown Bridge, and those that carry Interstate 80 and Route 4."}}
