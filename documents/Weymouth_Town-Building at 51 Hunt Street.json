{"Weymouth_Town": {"Building at 51 Hunt Street": "The Building at 51 Hunt Street in Quincy, Massachusetts is one of a relatively small number of triple decker apartment buildings in the city. Built in 1907 by Charles Stratton as part of his development of North Quincy as a rail-commuter suburb, it is a three-story wood frame structure, with a flat roof and wooden clapboard siding. The building is notable for its high parapet and its unusual porch balustrades."}}
