{"Worcester": {"Gilbert Hadley Three-Decker": "The Gilbert Hadley Three-Decker is an historic three-decker at 31 Russell Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1888, it is a well-preserved example of the form with Stick-style architecture. It is unusual for the arrangement of its porches, including a single-story porch that wraps around to the side, and three tiers of porches on both sides."}}
