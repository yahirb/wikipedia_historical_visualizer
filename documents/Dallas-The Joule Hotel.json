{"Dallas": {"The Joule Hotel": "The Joule Hotel is a five-star, 164-room boutique hotel developed by Headington Hotels. Located at 1530 Main Street, between Akard Street and Ervay Street, the building was constructed in 1927 as the Dallas National Bank Building, and was known later as the SPG Building. Positioned at the end of Stone Street Plaza, it is centralized in the Main Street District of downtown Dallas, Texas, and is one of two Gothic high-rises in the city, along with the Kirby Building. The Dallas National Bank completed construction of the office building in 1927.\nIt has garnered acclaim for its 10th floor pool that cantilevers eight feet over the easement below. The architect of the project was ARCHITEXAS (Architecture, Planning and Historic Preservation, Inc.) in Dallas.\nThe hotel interior was developed by world-renowned designer, Adam Tihany, and the lobby level is home to the highly acclaimed CBD Provisions restaurant.\nFrom 2005 through 2007, evidence of a fire was discovered during ongoing renovations of the building next to the Joule. According to pictures available at the Dallas Public Library, in 1951, a significant fire occurred at the National Shirt Shop and Manuel's Cleaners, former businesses directly to the East of the Dallas National Bank building. Additional historic images of the Dallas National Bank building are available through the Dallas Public Library dating back to 1927.
