{"Cary": {"NC State University (Lot 86, Farm Unit 1)": "NC State University (Lot 86, Farm Unit 1) is a Superfund site in Raleigh, North Carolina located to the north of Carter\u2013Finley Stadium. It is a 1.5-acre (6,100 m2) site that was used from 1969 until 1980 to dispose of hazardous waste from laboratories and research facilities. The North Carolina State University Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences began monitoring the site in 1981, drilling wells and sampling the groundwater. Groundwater remediation is currently being conducted at the site via pump and treat methods to remove chemicals of concern, including chloroform, bromoform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride.\n\"The groundwater remediation system consists of approximately 18 pumping wells that penetrate the contamination. Special chemical resistant pumps pump the contaminated groundwater to a treatment building above ground. Air Stripping is the primary form of treatment of the contaminated groundwater. Once treated, water is pumped to the sewer system for disposal.\"\nA solar farm is currently located on a portion of the site."}}
