{"Cleveland": {"First Church of Christ, Scientist (Cleveland, Ohio)": "The former First Church of Christ, Scientist, located at 2200 Overlook Road, in the University Circle area of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States is an historic building that was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 2003.\nBuilt from 1929 to 1931 at a cost of $1 million, it was designed by the noted Cleveland firm of Walker and Weeks, who later designed Severance Hall, to which this building is sometimes compared. An unusual feature of the building is its tall minaret-like semi-detached bell tower, which now functions only as a smokestack."}}
