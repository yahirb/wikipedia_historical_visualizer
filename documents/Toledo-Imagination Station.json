{"Toledo": {"Imagination Station": "Imagination Station (formerly the Center of Science and Industry (COSI)) is a non-profit, hands-on science museum located on the riverfront in downtown Toledo, Ohio. The facility has over 300 exhibits for \"children of all ages.\"\nAfter tax levies failed in 2006 and 2007, COSI closed its doors to the public on the last day of 2007 due to lack of funding. In 2008, voters approved an operating levy to reopen the facility using The Toledo Science Center as its interim name."}}
