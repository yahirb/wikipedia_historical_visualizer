{"North_Little_Rock": {"Pruniski House": "The Pruniski House is a historic house at 345 Goshen Avenue in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Built in 1937, it is a remarkably forward-looking house design, presaging a number of features not generally found in residential construction until after World War II. It is a two-story wood frame house with an attached two-car garage, a patio in the back yard, and a basement family room. The exterior is stylistically a revival of the Monterey style of architecture."}}
