{"Worcester": {"Charles Newton House": "The Charles Newton House is an historic house at 24 Brattle Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nBuilt in the 1830s or 1840s, the 2.5 story wood frame house is a rare local example of a house transitional between Federal and Greek Revival styling. The side hall, front gable plan is typically Greek Revival, but some details are Federalist, such as the narrow corner boards, and a doorway flanked by sidelight windows and surrounded by an architrave with corner and center blocks."}}
