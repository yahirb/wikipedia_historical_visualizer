{"Pittsburgh": {"Panther Hollow (Pittsburgh)": "Panther Hollow is a small, somewhat isolated neighborhood at the bottom of Joncaire Street in Junction Hollow that runs along Boundary Street and is located in the Central Oakland section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The neighborhood was settled in late 19th century mostly by Italian immigrants from Pizzoferrato and Gamberale, Italy. Even today, park benches and picnic tables in the neighborhood are painted in the red, white, and green of the Italian flag and a sign post marks the distance to the two Italian cities from which most of the original residents arrived."}}
