{"Tulsa": {"Tulsa parks and recreation": "The city of Tulsa manages 140 parks spread over 8,200 acres (3,300 ha). Individual parks range in size from Mohawk Park, the largest at 3,100 acres (1,300 ha) to small neighborhood parks, such as the 10-acre Braden Park in the White City area. The smallest is Creek Nation Council Oak Park at 1.86 acres (0.75 ha).\nLake Eucha Park is the only Tulsa city park not located within Tulsa County. It was created in 1952 as Lake Eucha State Park in Delaware County, Oklahoma, and was one of the state parks that Oklahoma decided to close for financial reasons in 2011. Instead, the City of Tulsa took over the ownership and management of the park. Lake Eucha is near the park and assures a constant supply of high-quality water to Spavinaw Lake, part of the Tulsa water supply system."}}
