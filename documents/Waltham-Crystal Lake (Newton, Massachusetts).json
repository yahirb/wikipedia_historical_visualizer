{"Waltham": {"Crystal Lake (Newton, Massachusetts)": "Crystal Lake is a 33-acre (130,000 m2) natural lake located in Newton, Massachusetts. Its shores, mostly lined with private homes, also host two small parks and a town beach and bath house. The name Crystal Lake was given to the pond by a nineteenth-century commercial ice harvester that sold ice cut from the pond in winter."}}
