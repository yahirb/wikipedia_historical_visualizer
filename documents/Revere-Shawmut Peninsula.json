{"Revere": {"Shawmut Peninsula": "Shawmut Peninsula is the promontory of land on which Boston, Massachusetts was built. The peninsula, originally a mere 789 acres (3.19 km2) in area, more than doubled in size due to land reclamation efforts that were a feature of the history of Boston throughout the 19th century.\n\n\n== Geology and original topography ==\nLike much of the Massachusetts landscape, the peninsula was shaped by glacial erosion and moraine deposits left by retreating glaciers at the end of the last ice age."}}
