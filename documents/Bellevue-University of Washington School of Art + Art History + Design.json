{"Bellevue": {"University of Washington School of Art + Art History + Design": "An art school is an educational institution with a primary focus on the visual arts, including fine art, especially illustration, painting, photography, sculpture, and graphic design. Art schools are institutions with elementary, secondary, post-secondary or undergraduate, or part of a broad-based range of programs (such as the liberal arts and sciences). France's \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts is, perhaps, the first model for such organized institution, breaking with a tradition of master and apprentice system when it was formed."}}
