{"Cincinnati": {"Cincinnati Gymnasium and Athletic Club": "The Cincinnati Gymnasium and Athletic Club is a historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Located on Shillito Place in the city's downtown, it was built for a club of the same name. Founded in 1853 by a group of Cincinnati elites, including Rutherford B. Hayes, the society chose to erect a new headquarters in 1902; at the time of its completion, this four-story building was hailed as one of the country's best athletic facilities, second only to the gymnasium at Columbia University in New York City."}}
