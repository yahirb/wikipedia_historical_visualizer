{"Evanston": {"Orth House": "The Orth House is a historic house located at 42 Abbotsford Road in Winnetka, Illinois. Walter Burley Griffin designed the Prairie School house, which was built in 1908. Griffin was a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, and he designed the Orth House shortly after starting his own studio; the house consequently resembles Wright's work more closely than Griffin's later work does."}}
