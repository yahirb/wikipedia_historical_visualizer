{"Cheyenne": {"William Sturgis House": "The William Sturgis House was built by cattle baron William Sturgis in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1884. The Shingle Style house was designed by architect George D. Rainsford, a New York architect who moved to Wyoming to raise Morgan horses and Clydesdales. While horse breeding was his principal occupation, Rainsford continued to practice architecture, designing many of the houses in the neighborhood surrounding the Sturgis residence."}}
