{"Daly_City": {"Pine Lake (San Francisco)": "Pine Lake Park is a park in the southwest corner of San Francisco, California which encompasses Pine Lake.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing their move from Maine to San Francisco in 1847, the Greene family purchased a large property which included Stern Grove and Pine Lake. In 1887, a lawsuit forced the family to give up most of the property and allowed them to retain only the portion which today comprises the park and adjacent Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove."}}
