{"Fall_River": {"Children's Home": "An orphanage is a residential institution devoted to the care of orphans\u2014children whose biological parents are deceased or otherwise unable or unwilling to take care of them. Biological parents, and sometimes biological grandparents, are legally responsible for supporting children, but in the absence of these, no named godparent, or other relatives willing to care for the children, they become a ward of the state, and orphanages are one way of providing for their care, housing and education.\nIt is frequently used to describe institutions abroad, where it is a more accurate term, since the word orphan has a different definition in international adoption."}}
