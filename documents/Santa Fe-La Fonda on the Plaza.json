{"Santa Fe": {"La Fonda on the Plaza": "La Fonda on the Plaza is a historical luxury hotel, located at 100 E. San Francisco Street and Old Santa Fe Trail in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico adjacent to the Plaza. La Fonda simply means \"the inn\" in Spanish, but the hotel has been described as \"the grand dame of Santa Fe's hotels.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe site of the current La Fonda has been the location of various inns since 1609. It is on the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which linked Mexico City to Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo and was the terminus of the 800-mile-long Old Santa Fe Trail, which linked Independence, Missouri to Santa Fe and was an essential commercial route prior to the 1880 introduction to the railroad."}}
