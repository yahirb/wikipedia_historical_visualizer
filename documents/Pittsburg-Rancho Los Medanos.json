{"Pittsburg": {"Rancho Los Medanos": "Rancho Los Medanos (from the Spanish: Rancho Los Meda\u00f1os meaning Sand Dunes Ranch) was a 8,859-acre (35.85 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Contra Costa County, California given in 1839 by Governor Juan Alvarado to Jose Antonio Mesa and Jose Miguel Garcia. The name \"los medanos\" is derived from the sand hills located along the San Joaquin River on its northern boundary. Rancho Los Medanos was located at the junction of the San Joaquin River and the Sacramento River, extending eastward along the south shore of Suisun Bay to Antioch."}}
