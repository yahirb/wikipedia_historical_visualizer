{"Glendale": {"Area code 602": "North American area code 602 is a state of Arizona telephone area code that covers most of the city of Phoenix. It was one of the original area codes established in October 1947 and originally covered the entire state of Arizona until 1995 when area code 520 was established as the state's second area code. While Arizona's explosive population growth during the second half of the 20th century would have made a split necessary in any event, it was hastened by the demand for telephone lines created by the proliferation of fax machines, cell phones and dial-up Internet connections."}}
