{"Longmont": {"Chivington Drive": "Chivington Drive was a street in Longmont, Colorado, United States which was named in 1977 after Colonel John Chivington the leader responsible for the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864. However, the name sparked controversy with proposals to change its title reaching the Longmont City Council three times over a period of more than two decades. Eventually a group called the \"Longmont Citizens for Justice and Democracy\" took up the campaign for the removal of Chivington's name."}}
