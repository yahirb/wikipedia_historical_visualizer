{"West_Des_Moines": {"Financial Center": "A financial centre is a location that is home to a cluster of nationally or internationally significant financial services providers such as banks, investment managers, hedge-funds or stock exchanges. A prominent financial centre can be described as an international financial centre (IFC) or a global financial centre and is often also a global city. Regional and national financial centres interact with these leading centres and may act as business feeders or provide local access to them."}}
