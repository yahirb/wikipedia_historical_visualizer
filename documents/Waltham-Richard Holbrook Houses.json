{"Waltham": {"Richard Holbrook Houses": "The Richard Holbrook Houses are a pair of joined historic houses at 29 and 31 Heard Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. Both are 1-1/2 story Greek Revival cottages, that once had detailed styling, which has since been lost or sided over. The two houses were built in 1844 by Richard Holbrook, a housewright, and are rare surviving examples of a once-common form."}}
