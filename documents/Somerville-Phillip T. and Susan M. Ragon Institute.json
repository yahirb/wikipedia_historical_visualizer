{"Somerville": {"Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute": "Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute is a medical institute founded in 2009 at the Massachusetts General Hospital by the funding from founder and CEO of InterSystems Phillip Ragon and his wife Susan Ragon to find vaccine for diseases of the immune system, particularly AIDS. The institute hopes to bring in scientists from Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a level I trauma center which is the largest teaching hospital affiliated with the Harvard University Medical School.\nThe Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute, or the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, was officially established in February 2009 with a dual mission: to contribute to the accelerated discovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine and subsequently to establish itself as a world leader in the collaborative study of immunology.\n\n\n== Aims ==\nFounded with a commitment of $100 million from the Ragons, the institute is structured and positioned to significantly contribute to a global effort to successfully develop an HIV/AIDS vaccine through:\ncreating non-traditional partnerships among experts with different but complementary backgrounds (e.g., engineers, basic immunologists, computational biologists, immunogeneticists, clinicians);\nproviding a means for rapidly funding promising studies (e.g., elite controllers, innovative viral vectors) and emerging concepts in the field (e.g., innate immune system memory);\nintegrating key facets of current vaccine development efforts that have tended to follow separate tracks (e.g., seeking a combined antibody and T-cell solution);\nproviding a substantial pool of accessible, flexible funding that will help lower the threshold for scientists to pursue risky, unconventional avenues of study that are unlikely to attract funding from traditional sources."}}
