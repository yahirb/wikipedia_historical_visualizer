{"New_Haven": {"Farm River (Connecticut)": "Farm River is a south-flowing river located entirely within the U.S. state of Connecticut. Because it begins as freshwater in its northern reaches and flows into tidal salt water at Long Island Sound, Farm River is by definition an estuary. The river is 16.5 miles (26.6 km) long."}}
