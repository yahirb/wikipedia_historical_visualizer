{"Sacramento": {"ARCO Arena (1985)": "ARCO Arena (originally called the Sacramento Sports Arena and later called the Original ARCO Arena or ARCO Arena I to distinguish it from its successor) was an indoor arena in Sacramento, California. It was the NBA's smallest arena as it held just 10,333 people and was built in 1985 to temporarily accommodate the NBA's Sacramento Kings, who had relocated from Kansas City.\nLocated north of Sacramento's downtown, ARCO Arena was nicknamed \"The Madhouse on Market Street\", and Kings games in this small venue were 100% sold out."}}
