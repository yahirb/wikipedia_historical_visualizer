{"Elgin": {"Santa's Village AZoosment Park": "Santa's Village AZoosment Park (formerly known as Santa's Village) is a theme park in East Dundee, Illinois. It was originally built by Glenn Holland, who also built two other Santa's Villages, in California; one located in San Bernardino County and the other in Santa Cruz County. The Illinois park, the third to be built, was projected to be the hub of a chain of Santa's Villages across the country."}}
