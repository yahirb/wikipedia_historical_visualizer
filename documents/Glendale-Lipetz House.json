{"Glendale": {"Lipetz House": "Raphael Soriano\u2019s first residential commission arose from his knowledge and passion for both language and music. The main feature of the house was to be a music room with excellent acoustic properties that could accommodate Mrs. Lipetz\u2019s Bechstein Grand piano and up to twenty guests."}}
