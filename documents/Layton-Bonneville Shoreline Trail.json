{"Layton": {"Bonneville Shoreline Trail": "The Bonneville Shoreline Trail is a mixed use (biking/hiking) recreation trail in Utah that will follow the shoreline of the ancient Lake Bonneville where today the Wasatch Front plays host to a growing region of outdoor enthusiasts. Some sections of the trail are complete and some are under developed. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail efforts hope to one day stretch from the Idaho border North of Logan, Utah run South all the way to Nephi, Utah."}}
