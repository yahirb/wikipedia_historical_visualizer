{"Raleigh": {"Vanguard Park Historic District": "Vanguard Park Historic District is a national historic district located between Bloomsbury and Roanoke Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is one of Raleigh's historic Five Points neighborhoods. Like Roanoke Park, its homes reflect the variety of popular architectural styles from the 1920s through the 1950s and are similar to those found in the nearby prestigious suburb of Hayes Barton, but are more modest in scale."}}
