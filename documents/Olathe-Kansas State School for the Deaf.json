{"Olathe": {"Kansas State School for the Deaf": "The Kansas School For the Deaf, is a K-12 school, located in downtown Olathe, Kansas. In 1866, it became the first school for the deaf established in the state of Kansas, and today it remains the largest. Originally named the \"Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb\", the name has been changed several times to conform to prevailing sensibilities about deafness."}}
