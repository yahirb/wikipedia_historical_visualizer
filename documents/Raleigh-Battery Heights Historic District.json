{"Raleigh": {"Battery Heights Historic District": "The Battery Heights Historic District is a historic neighborhood and national historic district located southeast of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Named for the earthen batteries stationed in the area during the Civil War, the neighborhood has a suburban character, despite its close proximity to the city center.\nThe district is roughly bounded by East Martin Street on the north, Battery Drive on the east, East Davie Street on the south, and Sherrybrook Drive (originally Cox Street) on the west. It has a highly intact collection of 18 contributing buildings built between 1956-1964 and is a good example of Raleigh's post-World War II suburban development."}}
