{"New_York": {"Odd Fellows Hall (New York City)": "The Odd Fellows Hall at 165-171 Grand Street between Centre and Baxter Streets, in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1847-48 and designed by the firm of Trench & Snook in the Italianate style, one of the city's earliest structures in this style, which Joseph Trench had brought to New York with his design for the A. T. Stewart store at 280 Broadway in 1845. His partner, John B. Snook, was responsible for many cast-iron buildings in the nearby SoHo neighborhood. The mansard roof was an addition, designed by John Buckingham and built in 1881-82."}}
