{"Lawrence": {"University of Kansas School of Architecture, Design, and Planning": "The School of Architecture and Design (Arc/D) is an independent professional school of the University of Kansas (KU) with programs in architecture and design.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe School traces its architectural roots to 1912 when KU's School of Engineering faculty established an undergraduate degree program in architectural engineering (ARCE). Existing faculty taught the initial architectural engineering courses, but Goldwin Goldsmith, a principal of the New York City architectural firm Van Vleck and Goldsmith, was hired as the first full-time faculty member and Chair of architectural engineering."}}
