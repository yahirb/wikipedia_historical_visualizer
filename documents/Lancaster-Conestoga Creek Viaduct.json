{"Lancaster": {"Conestoga Creek Viaduct": "The Conestoga Creek Viaduct spans the Conestoga River east of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The present structure, built in 1887-88, is a five-span, two-track stone arch railroad bridge. The first crossing at this location was a 1,412 feet (430 m) series of 11 wooden Town lattice trusses constructed in 1829 for the Columbia and Philadelphia Railroad, which was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and incorporated into its main line in 1857."}}
