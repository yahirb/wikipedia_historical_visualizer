{"Plano": {"Plano ISD Academy High School": "Plano ISD Academy High School, or Academy High School, is a STEAM, interdisciplinary and project-based learning high school. The school serves students from grades 9-12. This school is not a regular secondary school because this school uses a selection process to draw eighth graders from various middle schools throughout the Texas area. The school is an alternative to the regular high school experience by offering collaborative team projects, more STEAM classes and the ability to attend classes without structured class periods. This school is one of the three Academy Programs in Plano ISD. The others are the Plano Health Science Academy and the International Baccalaureate Program."}}
