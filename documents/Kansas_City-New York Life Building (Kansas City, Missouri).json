{"Kansas_City": {"New York Life Building (Kansas City, Missouri)": "The New York Life Building is a 12-story, 54.86 m (180.0 ft) high-rise in the Library District of downtown Kansas City, Missouri. The brick and brownstone tower, which was completed in 1890, generally is regarded as Kansas City's first skyscraper and was the first building in the city equipped with elevators. It was commissioned by the New York Life Insurance Company, which also used the same design for an identical building in Omaha that was completed in 1889."}}
