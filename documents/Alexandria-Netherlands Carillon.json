{"Alexandria": {"Netherlands Carillon": "The Netherlands Carillon adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery was a gift from the people of the Netherlands to the people of the United States in 1954. The gift was made to thank the United States for its aid during and after World War II. First installed at a nearby site in 1954, the 49-bell carillon was moved to the present tower (designed by ir J.W.C Boks) in 1960. A 50th bell was added following Dutch- and American-sponsored renovations in 1995, and dedicated on May 5, the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands."}}
