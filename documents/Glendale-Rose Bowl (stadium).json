{"Glendale": {"Rose Bowl (stadium)": "The Rose Bowl is a United States outdoor athletic stadium, located in Pasadena, California, a northeast suburb of Los Angeles. Opened 96 years ago in 1922, the stadium is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and a California Historic Civil Engineering landmark. At a modern capacity of an all-seated configuration at 90,888 (making it one of the rare stadiums in college football to have such a seating arrangement; many such stadiums have bench-style seating) the Rose Bowl is the 17th-largest stadium in the world, the 11th-largest stadium in the United States, and the 11th largest NCAA stadium."}}
