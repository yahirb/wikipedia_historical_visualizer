{"Smyrna": {"Mount Wilkinson": "Mount Wilkinson is a low mountain immediately north-northwest of and directly overlooking downtown Vinings, in southeast Cobb County, Georgia, USA. Although it rises significantly from the surrounding terrain, it is actually at or slightly below the average elevation for the region, as it is in the Chattahoochee River valley. Formerly called Signal Mountain, today it is commonly known as Vinings Mountain.\nIt is said that in 1864, U.S. Army General William T. Sherman got his first look at the church spires of Atlanta from the summit of Vinings Mountain."}}
