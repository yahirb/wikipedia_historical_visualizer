{"Cincinnati": {"Gruen Watch Co.": "The Gruen Watch Company was formerly one of the largest watch manufacturers in the United States. It was in business from about 1894 to 1958 and was based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded in 1908 by German-born watchmaker Dietrich Gr\u00fcn, who changed the spelling of his name to \"Gruen\" because the letter \u00fc does not exist in English."}}
