{"Dearborn": {"Fort Street\u2013Pleasant Street and Norfolk & Western Railroad Viaduct": "The Fort Street\u2013Pleasant Street and Norfolk & Western Railroad Viaduct is a bridge carrying six lanes of Fort Street over both Pleasant Street and multiple tracks comprising the Norfolk Southern Railway Detroit District (the former Wabash Railway mainline) and Conrail Shared Assets Lincoln Secondary and Junction Yard Secondary (respectively formerly operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad) lines on the border of the Boynton and Oakwood Heights neighborhoods in Detroit, Michigan, just west of the Rouge River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The bridge underwent massive repairs and other construction in late 2010 and throughout much of 2011, which included narrowing the Fort Street boulevard north of the viaduct into a six-lane undivided road with a left-turns-only lane."}}
