{"Weymouth_Town": {"Central Square Historic District (Weymouth, Massachusetts)": "The Central Square Historic District is a historic district encompassing an area in Weymouth, Massachusetts, which was historically significant in the pre-factory period of shoe manufacturing. It is centered at the intersection of Middle and Broad Streets, extending on Middle Street from Maple to Charles Streets, and on Broad from just west of the main junction to Putnam Street. Most of the houses built in this area between 1850 and 1870 were built for workers in relatively small shoemaking operations, one of which still stands at the main intersection."}}
