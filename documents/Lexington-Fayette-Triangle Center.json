{"Lexington-Fayette": {"Triangle Center": "In geometry, a triangle center (or triangle centre) is a point in the plane that is in some sense a center of a triangle akin to the centers of squares and circles, i.e. a point that is in the middle of the figure by some measure. For example the centroid, circumcenter, incenter and orthocenter were familiar to the ancient Greeks, and can be obtained by simple constructions."}}
