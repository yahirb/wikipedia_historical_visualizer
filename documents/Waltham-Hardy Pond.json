{"Waltham": {"Hardy Pond": "Hardy Pond is a 45-acre (180,000 m2) pond located in Waltham, Massachusetts. Originally almost twice the size, in recent times the pond level was lowered in an inappropriate approach to controlling flooding. The quality of the water has degraded due to eutrophication caused by run-off from roads, fertilizers, and storm drain inputs."}}
