{"Cambridge": {"Washington Elm": "The Washington Elm was a tree on Cambridge Common in Cambridge, Massachusetts that lived approximately 210 years and died in 1923.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeginning as early as the 1830s, it became popular legend that \"under this tree Washington first took command of the American Army\" (supposedly the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow). The publication of the fictional \"eye-witness\" journal The Diary of Dorothy Dudley in 1876 furthered the legend."}}
