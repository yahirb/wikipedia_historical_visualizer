{"Malden": {"Boston Navy Yard": "The Boston Navy Yard, originally called the Charlestown Navy Yard and later Boston Naval Shipyard, was one of the oldest shipbuilding facilities in the United States Navy. Established in 1801, the last year of the Federalist Party administration of President John Adams (1735-1826, served 1797-1801), as part of the recent establishment of the new U.S. Department of the Navy in 1798. After 175 years of vaunted military service, it was officially closed as an active naval installation on 1 July 1974, and the 30-acre (12 ha) property was transferred to the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior to be part of Boston National Historical Park."}}
