{"Brockton": {"Snow Fountain and Clock": "The Snow Fountain and Clock is a historic public monument at the southern junction of North Main and East Main Streets in Brockton, Massachusetts, USA. The monument was given to the city in 1902 by George C. Snow, who lived in a large house near the site. The monument has three major components: a water fountain, a horse trough, and a four-faced clock mounted on a 15-foot (4.6 m) column in the center of the water fountain. The trough and fountain are constructed of Quincy granite."}}
