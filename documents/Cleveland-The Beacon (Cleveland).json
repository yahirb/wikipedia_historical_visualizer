{"Cleveland": {"The Beacon (Cleveland)": "The Beacon is a skyscraper in downtown Cleveland that began construction at 515 Euclid Avenue in late 2017. The tower will be 355 feet (108 m) tall, with approval from the city council to exceed the city's 250 feet (76 m) limit. The building will be located on the GCRTA Euclid Corridor Rapid Bus Transit line that leads from Public Square to the University Circle district on the south east side of the city\nPart of the need for the tower is due to the two decade old resurgence of interest in downtown Cleveland. Residential population has upticked, spearheaded by a 77% increase of new housing units and 95% occupancy rate from 2000 to 2015 . This surge in residential growth has seen nearly 15,000 people living in the Cleveland neighborhood as of 2017. That makes downtown Cleveland the largest populated downtown in Ohio (far ahead of Columbus, Cincinnati, and Akron) which illustrates the need for more housing capacity in the central location of Cleveland. When completed it will be the third-tallest residential building in the city behind the Terminal Tower, which is slated to be converted into apartments, and The 9 Cleveland."}}
