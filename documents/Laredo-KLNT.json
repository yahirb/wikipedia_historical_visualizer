{"Laredo": {"KLNT": "KLNT (1490 AM) is a Country and Tejano format radio station that serves the Laredo, Texas, United States and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico border area.\n\n\n== History ==\n1490 AM signed on in 1952 as the original KVOZ. It broadcast with 250 watts. Barely a year after signing on, KVOZ attempted a move to 1240 kHz that was contingent on KGBS, the existing station at 1240 (now defunct), surrendering its license; this was denied."}}
