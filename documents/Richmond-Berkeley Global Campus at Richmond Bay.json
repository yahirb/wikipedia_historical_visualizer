{"Richmond": {"Berkeley Global Campus at Richmond Bay": "The Berkeley Global Campus at Richmond Bay, formerly the Richmond Bay campus and the Richmond Field Station, is a campus of the University of California, Berkeley, located in Richmond, California. The name was changed in October 2014, reflecting plans to expand the campus' scope, beyond the original plan to make it an extension of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Work on the extension had been halted due to federal budget cuts in 2013."}}
