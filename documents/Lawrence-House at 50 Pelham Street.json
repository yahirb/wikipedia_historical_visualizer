{"Lawrence": {"House at 50 Pelham Street": "The House at 50 Pelham Street in Methuen, Massachusetts is a well-preserved Italianate house and barn. Built sometime in the 1870s, the \u200b2 1\u20442-story wood-frame house features typical Italianate decorations, including extended bracketed eaves (not just on the roof but also on projecting window lintels), doubled brackets in the gable eaves, and a round-arch window in the gable end. The barn at the back of the property is a simple wood-frame structure that appears to date to the same period as the house."}}
