{"Kirkland": {"Great Western Iron and Steel Company": "The Great Western Iron and Steel Company was a company founded in the 1890s in Kirkland, Washington by the city's namesake Peter Kirk to build an integrated smelter and steel mill to refine local ore into steel for rails and other purposes. If the enterprise had proceeded as Kirk and other investors envisioned, it would have held a \"practical monopoly of the entire Pacific Coast\" steel production. But instead, the company went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893, and the mostly-completed mill never produced any steel."}}
