{"Chicago": {"Hotel St. Benedict Flats": "Hotel St. Benedict Flats is a historic apartment building located at the northeast corner of Chicago Avenue and Wabash Avenue in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1882, the building was one of the \"French flat\" luxury apartments constructed after the Great Chicago Fire; named for their resemblance to Parisian apartments, these new buildings brought apartment living to Chicago's upper class."}}
