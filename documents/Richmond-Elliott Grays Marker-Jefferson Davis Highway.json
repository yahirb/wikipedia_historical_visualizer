{"Richmond": {"Elliott Grays Marker-Jefferson Davis Highway": "The Jefferson Davis Highway, also known as the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, was a planned transcontinental highway in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s that began in Arlington, Virginia, and extended south and west to San Diego, California; it was named for Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, United States senator, and Secretary of War. Because of unintended conflict between the National Auto Trail movement and the federal government, it is unclear whether it ever really existed in the complete form that its United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) founders originally intended.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the first quarter of the 20th century, as the automobile gained in popularity, a system of roads began to develop informally through the actions of private interests."}}
