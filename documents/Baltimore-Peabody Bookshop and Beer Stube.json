{"Baltimore": {"Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube": "The Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube was a fixture in the Mount Vernon section of Baltimore, Maryland for over 50 years.\nThere was a crowded, dusty bookshop in front, and a crowded room in the back where customers could get beer and a sandwich. There was a piano on one wall, mounted animal heads, wooden tables carved with the names of patrons."}}
