{"Cicero": {"West Lawn, Chicago": "West Lawn, one of Chicago's 77 official community areas, is located on the southwest side of the city. It is considered to be a \"melting pot\" of sorts, due to its constant change of races moving in and out of the area, as well as the diversity that exists there. It has a small town atmosphere in the big city."}}
