{"Raleigh": {"Cameron Village": "Cameron Village was the first planned community to be developed in Raleigh, North Carolina. Development was started in 1947 when J.W. York and R.A Bryan bought 158 acres (0.64 km2) of undeveloped land two miles west of downtown Raleigh, near the North Carolina State University campus. The \"village\" was to consist of a shopping center, apartments, and single family homes."}}
