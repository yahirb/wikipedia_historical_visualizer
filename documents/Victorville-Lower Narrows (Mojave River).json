{"Victorville": {"Lower Narrows (Mojave River)": "The Mojave River is an intermittent river in the eastern San Bernardino Mountains and the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Most of its flow is underground, while its surface channels remain dry most of the time, with the exception of the headwaters and several bedrock gorges in the lower reaches.\n\n\n== History ==\nA desert branch of the Serrano Native Americans called the Vanyume or Be\u00f1em\u00e9, as Father Garc\u00e9s called them, lived beyond and along much of the length of the Mojave River, from east of Barstow to at least the Victorville region, and perhaps even farther upstream to the south, for up to 8,000 years."}}
