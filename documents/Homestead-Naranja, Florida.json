{"Homestead": {"Naranja, Florida": "Naranja is a census-designated place (CDP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Many orange groves were once located in this area, so the community name came from the Spanish word for orange, \"naranja\", but the actual pronunciation is (Na-Ran-Jah) among the local residents. Naranja was also a stop for the Florida East Coast Railroad that once ran through this area."}}
