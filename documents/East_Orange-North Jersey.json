{"East_Orange": {"North Jersey": "North Jersey comprises the northern portions of the U.S. state of New Jersey between the upper Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean. The designation of northern New Jersey with a distinct toponym is a colloquial one rather than an administrative one, reflecting not only geographical but also perceived cultural differences from the southern part of the state, with no official definition.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGeologically, the north is in the Piedmont Province, the Highlands Province, and the Ridge and Valley Province."}}
