GAMC is one of the city's oldest businesses, founded in 1905, a year before Glendale was incorporated as a city. It was then known as Glendale Sanitarium, and it occupied the former Glendale Hotel, a 75-room Victorian structure on what is now Broadway Avenue.\nIt was owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, as part of its mission of community caring that helped form its reputation as a \"health resort\" of choice."}}
