{"Danbury": {"Cosier-Murphy House": "The Cosier-Murphy House is a historic house at 67 Connecticut Route 39 in New Fairfield, Connecticut. It is a two-story wood frame structure, three bays wide, a front-gable roof and shed-roof additions to the side and rear. It has a side-hall plan, with the main entrance in the right-hand bay, and shortened windows on the second floor, in what appears to be an expanded frieze band above corner pilasters."}}
