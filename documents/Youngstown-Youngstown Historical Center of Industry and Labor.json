{"Youngstown": {"Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor": "The Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor, located in Youngstown, Ohio, preserves the history of the steel industry that dominated the Youngstown area's economic life for much of the 20th century. The museum is owned by the Ohio Historical Society and operated by Youngstown State University. The facility, which was designed by noted architect Michael Graves, is reminiscent of a steel mill, complete with stylized smoke stacks."}}
