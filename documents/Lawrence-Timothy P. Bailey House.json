{"Lawrence": {"Timothy P. Bailey House": "The Timothy P. Bailey House is a historic house at 210 Chandler Road in Andover, Massachusetts. It was built by Timothy Palmer Bailey, on land purchased from his father's estate. The Baileys were successful farmers, and the younger one, who was educated at Phillips Academy, built this locally rare example of an Italianate house in 1878."}}
