{"West_Allis": {"The Sower (sculpture)": "The Sower is a public art work by artist Gustav Bohland, located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The bronze sculpture depicts an agricultural worker dressed in overalls and carrying a seed bag. The figure's shirt sleeves are rolled up past his elbows and the wide brim of a hat shades his face."}}
