{"Rochester": {"Irondequoit Creek": "Irondequoit Creek is a stream in eastern Monroe County, New York that feeds Irondequoit Bay. It actually begins in rural West Bloomfield in Ontario County, flowing north into the town of Mendon in Monroe County. Accumulating a few small tributaries, it twists eastward back into the Ontario County town of Victor, then back north into Monroe County, where it flows through the towns of Perinton and Penfield on its way to the bay."}}
