{"New_Braunfels": {"Hotel Faust": "The Faust Hotel, once known as the Travelers Hotel, was completed in 1929 and is located in New Braunfels, Texas. The hotel planning was started by a group of citizens desiring to attract tourist and convention traffic to counter a downturn in agricultural business caused by a mid-1920s drought in the area. Built on donated land from Senator Joseph Faust's estate, the hotel was renamed in 1936 in honor that family."}}
