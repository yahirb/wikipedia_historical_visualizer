{"Normal": {"Fans Field (Bloomington)": "Fans Field was a minor league baseball park in Bloomington, Illinois, and was home to the Bloomington franchise of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League, popularly known as the Three-I League or jokingly as the Three-Eye League, from the early 1900s through 1939. The team had various names, but was primarily known as the Bloomington Bloomers, as well as the Bloomington Blues, Bloomington Bengals, Bloomington Cubs and Bloomington Cardinals. It was a short block east of South Main Street, on the south side of Lafayette, perhaps not coincidentally near the Brewery that sat just west of South Main and served the city's significant German population well."}}
