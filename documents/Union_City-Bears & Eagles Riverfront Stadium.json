{"Union_City": {"Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium": "Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium, originally simply Riverfront Stadium, is a 6,200-seat baseball park in Newark, New Jersey, United States, that is home to the baseball teams of two of Newark's universities: the Rutgers-Newark Scarlet Raiders, who play in the New Jersey Athletic Conference as part of NCAA Division III, and the NJIT Highlanders, who play in the Atlantic Sun Conference as part of NCAA Division I.\nThe impetus for the stadium's construction was the awarding of an expansion franchise in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent minor baseball league, in 1999. The team took the name Newark Bears, and the stadium hosted its first regular season baseball game on July 16, 1999 when the Bears took on the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds. The Bears played in the stadium from 1999 until 2013, having later moved to the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball, before the team was folded."}}
