{"Trenton": {"Abbott\u2013Decou House": "The Abbott\u2013Decou House was built by Samuel Abbott in 1797 in what is now Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey. In 1888 it came into the possession of the DeCou family, whose matriarch, known locally as \"Aunt Martha,\" had a considerable influence in local affairs. The house is considered a particularly fine example of 18th century Quaker Georgian architecture."}}
