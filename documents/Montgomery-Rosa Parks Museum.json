{"Montgomery": {"Rosa Parks Museum": "Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 \u2013 October 24, 2005) was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement, whom the United States Congress called \"the first lady of civil rights\" and \"the mother of the freedom movement\".\nOn December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks refused to obey bus driver James F. Blake's order to give up her seat in the \"colored section\" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation."}}
