{"Terre_Haute": {"Terre Haute House": "The Terre Haute House was a historic former hotel located in downtown Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, that was demolished despite numerous efforts to preserve it. The hotel was replaced by a Hilton Garden Inn, which opened in 2007.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nSince being closed in 1970, the Terre Haute House was considered by some as a faded reminder of Terre Haute's somewhat sordid past as a midwestern \u201cSin City\u201d and, in the years since its closure, it came to be viewed by some in the city as an impediment to downtown revitalization."}}
