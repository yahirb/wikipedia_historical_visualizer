Los Angeles St. Often called \"The Glass House\", the building was named for former LAPD chief William H. Parker. Originally called the Police Administration Building (PAB) (or Police Facilities Building), groundbreaking for the center began on December 30, 1952, and construction was completed in 1955. The architect was Welton Becket. The building combined police facilities that had been located throughout the Civic Center area. The location was previously home to the Olympic Hotel.\nOn July 16, 1966, Chief Parker had a fatal heart attack. Soon afterward, the Los Angeles City Council renamed the building \"Parker Center\". The building was one of the sites of unrest during the 1992 Los Angeles riots following a not guilty verdict for the four police officers in the Rodney King matter."}}
