{"Hartford": {"Chevry Lomday Mishnayes Synagogue": "Chevry Lomday Mishnayes Synagogue is a historic former synagogue building at 148-150 Bedford Street in Hartford, Connecticut. Built in 1924, it is unusual for an ecclesiastical structure in that its design appears to be based on that of an apartment house. It housed an Orthodox Jewish congregation until 1963, and now houses the local House of God Church."}}
