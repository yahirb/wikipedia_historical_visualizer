{"Albany": {"University Field (Albany)": "University Field was a 10,000-seat multi-purpose stadium in Albany, New York. It was home to the University at Albany Great Danes football team from its opening in 1970 until 2012. The stadium was demolished after the football team's final game; after a major renovation to upgrade the site's track & field facilities, the site reopened in the fall of 2013 as the home for Albany's men's and women's teams in that sport."}}
