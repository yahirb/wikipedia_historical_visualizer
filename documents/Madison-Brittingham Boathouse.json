{"Madison": {"Brittingham Boathouse": "The Brittingham Boathouse is a historic boathouse located on North Shore Drive along a bay of Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin. Built in 1909-10, it is the city's oldest extant public park building. The Madison Park and Pleasure Drive Association, an association of civic leaders which established many of Madison's first parks, commissioned the boathouse as a public facility for the surrounding working-class neighborhood."}}
