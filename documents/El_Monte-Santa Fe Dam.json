{"El_Monte": {"Santa Fe Dam": "Santa Fe Dam is a flood-control dam on the San Gabriel River located in Irwindale in Los Angeles County, California. For most of the year, the 92-foot (28 m)-high dam and its reservoir lie empty, but can hold more than 45,000 acre feet (56,000,000 m3) of water during major storms. During the dry season, the basin behind the dam is used for groundwater recharge, as well as various recreational activities."}}
