{"Los_Angeles": {"Continental Building": "The Continental Building, formerly Braly Block, is a 151 ft (46 m), 13-story high-rise residential building at 408 South Spring Street in the Historic Core of Los Angeles, California. When completed in 1903, it was the city's first high-rise building, and remained the tallest commercial building for fifty-three years. Shortly after the building was completed, the Los Angeles City Council enacted a 150 ft (46 m) height restriction on future buildings that remained until the 1950s."}}
