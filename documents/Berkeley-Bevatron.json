{"Berkeley": {"Bevatron": "The Bevatron was a particle accelerator \u2014 specifically, a weak-focusing proton synchrotron \u2014 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S., which began operating in 1954. The antiproton was discovered there in 1955, resulting in the 1959 Nobel Prize in physics for Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain. It accelerated protons into a fixed target, and was named for its ability to impart energies of billions of eV. (Billions of eV Synchrotron.)\n\n\n== Antiprotons ==\nAt the time the Bevatron was designed, it was strongly suspected but not known, that each particle had a corresponding anti-particle of opposite charge, identical in all other respects, a property known as charge symmetry."}}
