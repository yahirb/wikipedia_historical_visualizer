{"Santa_Cruz": {"Santa Cruz Shakespeare": "Santa Cruz Shakespeare is an annual professional theatre festival in Santa Cruz, California, founded in 2014. Its predecessor, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, lost the financial support of its host and sponsor, the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2013. Members of the original company immediately began fundraising and raised enough money to relaunch the festival as an independent entity."}}
