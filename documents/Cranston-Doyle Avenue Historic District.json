{"Cranston": {"Doyle Avenue Historic District": "The Doyle Avenue Historic District is a predominantly residential historic district on the East Side of Providence, Rhode Island. It extends along Doyle Avenue from North Main Street in the west to Proctor Place (just short of Hope Avenue). This area was developed residentially between 1860 and 1920, with an architecturally diverse collection of houses (single and multi-unit dwellings), generally set on small lots with only modest setback from the sidewalk."}}
