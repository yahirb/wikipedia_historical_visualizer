{"Fayetteville": {"Mack Morton Barn": "The Mack Morton Barn is a historic eleven-sided barn at 11516 Appleby Road in Appleby, Arkansas. Built about 1900 to house cows and horses, it is sheathed in board-and-batten siding and topped by a hip roof with an eleven-sided cupola at the center. It is believed to be the only surviving geometrically unusual barn in the state."}}
