{"Worcester": {"Helen Dodge Three-Decker": "The Helen Dodge Three-Decker is an historic three-decker house at 570 Pleasant Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1912, the well preserved, architecturally eclectic building is representative of the final stages of three-decker development, and its penetration into the fashionable upper-class west side of the city. The three-tier porch is distinctive for its semi-circular arch openings, and there is an unusual square bay projecting from the corner opposite the entry."}}
