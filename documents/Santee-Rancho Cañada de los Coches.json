{"Santee": {"Rancho Ca\u00f1ada de los Coches": "Rancho Ca\u00f1ada de los Coches was a 28-acre (0.11 km2) Mexican land grant in present day San Diego County, California given in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Apolinaria Lorenzana. This small land grant was located just west of Flinn Springs and in the center of Rancho El Cajon. The San Diego Mission fathers formerly watered their swine in dry seasons at a little spring arising from subterranean sources, thus giving it its name of \"Glen of the Hogs\"."}}
