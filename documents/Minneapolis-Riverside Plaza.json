{"Minneapolis": {"Riverside Plaza": "Riverside Plaza is a modernist and brutalist apartment complex designed by Ralph Rapson that opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1973. Situated on the edge of downtown Minneapolis in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, and next to the University of Minnesota's West Bank, the site contains the 39-story McKnight Building, the tallest structure outside of the city's central business district. Initially known as Cedar Square West, exterior shots of the complex were featured on television as the residence of Mary Richards in sixth and seventh seasons of The Mary Tyler Moore Show."}}
