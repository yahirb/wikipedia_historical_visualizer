{"Bayonne": {"Hudson Catholic Regional High School": "Hudson Catholic Regional High School is a regional four-year co-educational University-preparatory Catholic high school in Jersey City, in Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. The school was established in 1964 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, and currently serves young men and young women in ninth through twelfth grades. The high school was conducted by the De La Salle Christian Brothers of the Baltimore District, later the District of Eastern North America, from its inception until 2008; the remaining Brothers were withdrawn in the summer of 2012, leaving the school entirely in the hands of the Archdiocesan education office."}}
