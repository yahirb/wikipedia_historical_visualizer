{"New_Orleans": {"Decatur Street (New Orleans)": "Decatur Street is a street in the French Quarter neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA that runs parallel to the Mississippi River. Decatur was formerly known as \"Levee Street\" or Rue de la Lev\u00e9e, as it was originally the location of the levee. In 1870, when the river had altered its course, it was renamed \"Decatur Street\" in honor of the naval hero Stephen Decatur."}}
