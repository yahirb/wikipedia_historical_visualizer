{"Montgomery": {"New ASU Stadium": "The New ASU Stadium on the campus of Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama is a 26,500-seat stadium that replaces the Cramton Bowl as the host venue for the Alabama State Hornets football team. The first game in the New ASU Stadium was the 89th Turkey Day Classic on November 22, 2012 in which the Hornets hosted the Tuskegee Golden Tigers. The game was a sell-out and was televised nationally on ESPNU. Unfortunately for the Hornets, they lost the first ever game in their new stadium 27-25 due to a late two-point conversion by Tuskegee."}}
