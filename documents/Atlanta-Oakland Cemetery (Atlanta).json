{"Atlanta": {"Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta)": "Oakland Cemetery is one of the largest cemeteries green spaces, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. Founded as \"Atlanta Cemetery\" in 1850 on six acres (2.4 hectares) of land southeast of the city, it was renamed in 1872 to reflect the large number of oak and magnolia trees growing in the area. By that time, the city had grown and the cemetery had enlarged correspondingly to the current 48 acres (190,000 m2). Since then, Atlanta has continued to expand, so that the cemetery is now located in the center of the city."}}
