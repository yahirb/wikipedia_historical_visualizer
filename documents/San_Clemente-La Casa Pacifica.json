{"San_Clemente": {"La Casa Pacifica": "La Casa Pacifica (Spanish for \"The Pacific House\"; translated also as \"The House of Peace\") is a classic California beachfront mansion located in the gated community of Cottons Point Estates/Cypress Shores in the casual South Orange County beach town of San Clemente, California, and overlooks the Pacific Ocean from its blufftop position. This estate is also known as President Richard Nixon's Western White House, used while living and working outside of the official presidential residence, the White House in Washington D.C.\nThe large Spanish-style California Mission Revival mansion was modeled after a country home in San Sebastian, Spain and was designed by architect Carl Lindbom. It was built in 1926 for Hamilton H. Cotton, one of the founding financiers of the city of San Clemente, and a Democratic Party backer who entertained party luminaries, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as guests in his home."}}
