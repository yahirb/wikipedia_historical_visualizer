{"Joplin": {"Durward G. Hall Federal Building and United States Courthouse": "The Durward G. Hall Federal Building and United States Courthouse is an historic building located in Joplin, Missouri. Completed in 1904 and added to in 1936, the courthouse was constructed during a time of initial growth for the City of Joplin, following several years of civic effort to obtain a Federal Post Office and Courthouse. Originally constructed to house a U.S. Post Office, Federal Court Room and offices for various public agencies, today it stands as a well-preserved example of the neo-classical revival style popular in Federal buildings of the period."}}
