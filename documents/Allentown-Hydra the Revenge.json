{"Allentown": {"Hydra the Revenge": "Hydra the Revenge (sometimes simply shortened to Hydra) is a steel Floorless Coaster at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the only Floorless Coaster in Pennsylvania and was built where the former wooden roller coaster Hercules once stood, which was closed and demolished at the end of the park's 2003 season. Its name comes from the Greek Mythology story where Hercules battled the Hydra."}}
