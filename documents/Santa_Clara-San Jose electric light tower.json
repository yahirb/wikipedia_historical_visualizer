{"Santa_Clara": {"San Jose electric light tower": "The San Jose electric light tower was constructed in 1881 at an intersection in downtown San Jose, California, as a \"high light\" or moonlight tower to light the city using arc lights. A pioneer use of electricity for municipal lighting, it was later strung with incandescent bulbs and was destroyed in a storm in December 1915. A half-size replica stands at History Park at Kelley Park."}}
