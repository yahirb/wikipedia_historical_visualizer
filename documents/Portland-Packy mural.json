{"Portland": {"Packy mural": "The Packy mural was a public artwork depicting the elephant of the same name, painted on the Skidmore Fountain Building in Portland, Oregon's Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. The artwork was designed by Eric Larsen and painted in 1990 by North Pacific Sign and Design, but was destroyed during the building's 2008 renovation to become the new headquarters for Mercy Corps.\nThe mural received a generally positive reception, though in 1997 the president of the company that owned the building expressed his desire to replace the artwork, which he considered a free advertisement for the Oregon Zoo."}}
