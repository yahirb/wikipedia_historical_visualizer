{"Berkeley": {"Cheese Board Collective": "The Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley, California, comprises two worker owned and operated businesses: a cheese shop/bakery commonly referred to as \"The Cheese Board\", and a pizzeria known as \"Cheese Board Pizza\". Along with Peet's Coffee, the Cheese Board is known for its role in starting the North Shattuck neighborhood of Berkeley on its way to becoming famous as a culinary destination: the \"Gourmet Ghetto\". The Cheese Board brought a European focus on cheeses but also emphasized locally grown cheeses, a novel concept in the 1970s."}}
