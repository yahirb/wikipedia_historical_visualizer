{"Doral": {"Tamiami Park": "Tamiami Park is a public urban park in metropolitan Miami, just south of the Modesto Maidique campus of Florida International University.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe park was built in the late 1960s on the site of the former Tamiami Airport, which was rebuilt as a larger airport south in Kendall. Growth of the surrounding area and the nearby flight path for Miami International Airport forced the relocation of the municipal airport."}}
