{"Malden": {"House at 35 Temple Street": "The House at 35 Temple Street in Somerville, Massachusetts was one of the few 18th century houses in the city. The 2.5 story wood frame house was probably built between 1750 and 1780, and had retained most of its Georgian features, including a steeply pitched gambrel roof. The house was probably moved to this location from Broadway or Mystic Avenue in the 19th century."}}
