{"Buffalo": {"Humboldt\u2013Hospital station": "Humboldt-Hospital is a Buffalo Metro Rail station located at the western terminus of Kensington Avenue and Main Street and is the only station with entrances on both sides of the Main Street for passengers to enter and exit from. To not confuse, Kensington Avenue rejoins Main Street in Snyder, New York at its eastern terminus. Since Humboldt-Hospital station served as a terminal due to Amherst Street station serving as the northern terminus from May 20, 1985 to November 10, 1986, about 580 feet north is a double crossover."}}
