Buffet, is a restaurant and bar located at 118 East 6th Street in the Historic Core district of downtown Los Angeles, California.\n\nCole's had boasted being the oldest restaurant and bar in the city of Los Angeles continuously operated from the same location--inclusive of a shutdown for major remodeling on March 15, 2007. The restaurant's new owner, downtown bar/restaurant entrepreneur Cedd Moses, was quoted in the Los Angeles Downtown News, saying the restaurant would reopen in time for its 100th anniversary in January 2008; however, the project was delayed, and Cole's finally reopened in December 2008."}}
