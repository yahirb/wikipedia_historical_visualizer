{"New_York": {"Bridge Cafe": "Bridge Cafe was an historic restaurant and bar located at 279 Water Street in the South Street Seaport area of Manhattan, New York City, United States. The site was originally home to \"a grocery and wine and porter bottler\", opened in 1794, and has been home to a series of drinking and eating establishments. In the nineteenth century the building was described in city directories variously as a grocery, a porterhouse, or a liquor establishment. Henry Williams operated a brothel there from 1847 to 1860 and the prostitutes were listed in the New York City census of 1855. In 1888, the building's exterior was altered to its present form. The building was damaged during Hurricane Sandy, and the restaurant remains closed as of 2017. Until its closure, it was the city's oldest continuous business establishment and had been under the same ownership since 1979.\nWhile in office, Mayor Edward I. Koch regularly had dinner at Bridge Cafe and declared it to be his favorite restaurant.\nNew York considered it to be one of New York City's Top 5 Historic Bars."}}
