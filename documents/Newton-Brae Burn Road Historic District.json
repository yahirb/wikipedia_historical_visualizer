{"Newton": {"Brae Burn Road Historic District": "The Brae Burn Road Historic District is a residential historic district on Brae Burn and Windermere Roads in Newton, Massachusetts. It encompasses as modest residential subdivision that was laid out in the then-rural area of Auburndale in 1911. Many of its houses were designed by the regionally notable firm of Gay & Proctor, and represent a well-preserved collection of modestly scaled Craftsman and Colonial Revival style houses."}}
