{"Baton_Rouge": {"St. James Episcopal Church (Baton Rouge, Louisiana)": "The St. James Episcopal Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana is an Episcopal church founded in 1844. It is located at 208 N. 4th Street in Baton Rouge. Its Gothic Revival-style building, built during 1889-95, was designed by architect Colonel W.L. Stevens. It replaced the original frame building of the church which had been built in 1845-46.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It was then the second oldest Gothic Revival church in the city of Baton Rouge. Its NRHP nomination describes: \"Because of its side tower and substantial proportions, it is closer in feeling to the ecclesiastical, mid-century Gothic Revival style than the older church, St. Joseph's, whose massing is symmetrical and whose proportions are thin and papery. The church is also a local landmark.\""}}
