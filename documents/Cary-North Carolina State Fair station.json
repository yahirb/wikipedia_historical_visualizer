{"Cary": {"North Carolina State Fair station": "North Carolina State Fair is a seasonal Amtrak station serving the North Carolina State Fairground in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is served by Amtrak's Carolinian and is only open when the fair is in operation. The Piedmont also passes by the station, but does not stop here.\nAmtrak lists the address as being at \"1025 Blue Ridge Boulevard at the railroad crossing, North Carolina State Fair, North Carolina,\" rather than the City of Raleigh itself, and the correct name of the street. The station waiting area is covered by a tent on the southwest corner of Blue Ridge Road and North Carolina State Highway 54 (Hillsborough Street), and tickets are sold at a portable shed near the State Fair building, which can be found across NC 54 on the northwest corner of Blue Ridge Boulevard. Wheelchair carriers are located near the grade crossings and are the closest resemblance to accessibility for handicapped passengers.\nAcross the tracks from the fairgrounds is an abandoned freight spur leading to what is today a North Carolina Department of Transportation equipment storage facility along Beryl Road, as well as another one leading to what is now a storage warehouse. Sidetracks exist on both sides of the tracks between Powell Drive and Blue Ridge Road."}}
