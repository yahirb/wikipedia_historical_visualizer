{"Worcester": {"Thomas Crabtree Three-Decker": "The Thomas Crabtree Three-Decker is historic triple-decker house at 22 Haynes Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built in 1914, it is a remarkably well-preserved and detailed example of the style in Worcester's University Park neighborhood. It has a typical side hall plan, and a hip roof that sports a small gable dormer on the front elevation."}}
