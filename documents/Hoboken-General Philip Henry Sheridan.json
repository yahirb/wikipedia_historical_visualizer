{"Hoboken": {"General Philip Henry Sheridan": "Philip Henry Sheridan (March 6, 1831 \u2013 August 5, 1888) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \"The Burning\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war."}}
