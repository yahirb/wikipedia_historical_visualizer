{"Portsmouth": {"Virginia National Bank Headquarters Historic District": "The Virginia National Bank Headquarters Historic District encompasses a skyscraper, parking garage, and public plaza in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. Bounded by East Main and Atlantic Streets, Commercial Place, and Waterside Drive, it includes the 24-story Virginia National Bank building, constructed in 1965-67 to a design by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, one of Virginia's leading architectural firms of the period. The accompanying plaza and garage formed part of the design, and are a significant example of mid-20th century architecture and landscape design principles."}}
