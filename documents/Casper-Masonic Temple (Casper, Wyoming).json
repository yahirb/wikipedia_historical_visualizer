{"Casper": {"Masonic Temple (Casper, Wyoming)": "The Masonic Temple in downtown Casper, Wyoming is a Masonic hall, built in 1914 during a boom time initiated by the development of the Salt Creek Oil Field. Located on a corner site, the temple remains essentially as it was designed by Casper architect Homer F. Shaffer. The four story light-colored brick building rests on a raised basement and is topped by a crenelated parapet."}}
