{"New_York": {"Millennium Hilton New York Downtown": "The Millennium Hilton New York Downtown is a Hilton hotel in Lower Manhattan, New York City, located at the southeast corner of Fulton Street and Church Street. The hotel is adjacent to One World Trade Center. The building is 55 stories tall, with a total of 471 guest rooms and 98 suites.\nThe hotel was known for many years as the Millenium Hilton. The hotel's builder chose to intentionally misspell the name with one \"n\" as \"Millenium\" on the outdoor signage and official literature, even though the correct spelling of the English word is \"millennium\", in order to make the name more distinctive."}}
