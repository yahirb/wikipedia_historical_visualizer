{"Hamilton": {"High Street Commercial Block": "The High Street Commercial Block is a miniature historic district in downtown Hamilton, Ohio, United States. Three buildings compose the block: the old Second National Bank Building, the Howell-Sohngen Building, and McCrory's. All are three-story masonry buildings in some form of the Italianate style, and while all feature arched windows on their upper stories, the styles of arches and the varied employment of rectangular windows, together with their varied cornices, causes the styling to be diverse."}}
