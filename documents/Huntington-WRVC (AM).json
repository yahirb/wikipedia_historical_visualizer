{"Huntington": {"WRVC (AM)": "WRVC is the oldest operating radio station in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was originally called WSAZ Radio (see WSAZ), the same call letters used for Channel 3 TV when it came into being in the late 1940s, and the television station still uses that long-time call. WRVC AM & FM is located in Huntington, West Virginia and is West Virginia's oldest continually licensed station."}}
