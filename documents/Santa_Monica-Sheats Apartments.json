{"Santa_Monica": {"Sheats Apartments": "The Sheats Apartments, also known as L'Horizon and sometimes mistakenly as the Sheets Apartments, is a historic eight-unit, multi-family building located at 10919 Strathmore Drive, in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Designed in 1948 in a futuristic or modernistic style of architecture by noted Los Angeles architect John Lautner, it was completed in 1949 for owners Helen Taylor Sheats, a renowned artist, who assisted in the design, and her professor/dean of University of California Extension husband, Paul Henry Sheats. Because of its proximity to UCLA, it was intended for and has been used primarily for student occupancy."}}
