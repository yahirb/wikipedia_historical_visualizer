{"Minneapolis": {"Harry F. Legg House": "The Harry F. Legg House is a house in the Elliot Park neighborhood just south of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The house appears to have been built by a tract housing developer, and its style reflects that of houses for middle to upper-class professional families in the late 18th century. The house retains its Queen Anne architectural integrity, having been altered little since it was originally built."}}
