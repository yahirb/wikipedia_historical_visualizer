The museum covers the 250+ year relationship with the shipyard - America's oldest and largest naval shipyard located on the Portsmouth Waterfront. The city and the shipyard have been intertwined since the founding of the Gosport Shipyard in 1767, which was later renamed Norfolk Navy Yard and finally Norfolk Naval Shipyard."}}
