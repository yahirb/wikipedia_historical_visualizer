{"Worcester": {"Erick Kaller Three-Decker": "There are two noteworthy triple decker apartment houses built by Erick Kaller at 146 and 148 Eastern Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. Both were built in 1894 in a Queen Anne style, and were nearly identical, with projecting polygonal bay windows, and a single-story porch sheltering the entrance. The principal difference between the two is that 148 Eastern has flared siding skirts below its projecting bay windows."}}
