{"Rochester": {"Frontier Field": "Frontier Field is a baseball stadium located at One Morrie Silver Way in downtown Rochester, New York. The park opened in 1996, replacing Silver Stadium in northern Rochester, which had been home to professional baseball in Rochester since 1929. Although the stadium was built for baseball, Frontier Field has had several tenants in numerous sports, including the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the United Soccer Leagues from 1996 to 2005, the Rochester Rattlers of Major League Lacrosse from 2001 to 2002, and the Rochester Red Wings of the International League since 1997."}}
