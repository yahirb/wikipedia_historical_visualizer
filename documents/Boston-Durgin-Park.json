{"Boston": {"Durgin-Park": "Durgin-Park is a centuries-old restaurant at 340 Faneuil Hall Marketplace in downtown Boston. The Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau states that it has been a \"landmark since 1827\", and it continues to be a popular tourist destination within Quincy Market. The restaurant has entrances on both of its facades (Faneuil Hall and Clinton Street).\nIn keeping with its long history, the concept of Durgin-Park maintains the tradition of communal seating at long tables. The menu is designed to offer traditional New England-style fare with a concentration on seafoods, chowders, broiled meats and boiled dinners. The service is also a partial hold-over from the time of its founding as the waitstaff have been encouraged to adopt a \"surly\" attitude and \"backtalk\" the clientele. Another sign of its heritage is that it has only changed head chefs a handful of times in its history."}}
