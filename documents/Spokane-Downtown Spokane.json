{"Spokane": {"Downtown Spokane": "Downtown Spokane, officially the Riverside neighborhood, is the central business district in Spokane, Washington. Downtown Spokane's rough boundaries are I-90 to the south, Division Street to the east, Maple Street to the west, and across the Spokane River north to Boone Avenue. Bridges (some of them pedestrian-only) span the river at nearly every block."}}
