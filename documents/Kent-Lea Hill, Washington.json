{"Kent": {"Lea Hill, Washington": "Lea Hill is a neighborhood outside the cities of Auburn and Kent, Washington, United States. This is evident as one passes the \"Auburn City Limits\" sign before making the turn up Lake Holm Drive, or Kent city limits on 124th Ave SE. The community was annexed by Auburn on January 1, 2008, after Auburn and Lea Hill residents approved the annexation. The name Lea Hill is not used consistently; names such as Washington National Golf Course, which includes its own community of million dollar homes, and nearby Heather Highlands, are sometimes used in its favor."}}
