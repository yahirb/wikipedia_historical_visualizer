{"Eugene": {"Trapezoid E": "In Euclidean geometry, a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides is referred to as a trapezoid () in American and Canadian English but as a trapezium () in English outside North America. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid and the other two sides are called the legs or the lateral sides (if they are not parallel; otherwise there are two pairs of bases). A scalene trapezoid is a trapezoid with no sides of equal measure, in contrast to the special cases below."}}
