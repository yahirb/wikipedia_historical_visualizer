{"Pittsburgh": {"Hill District (Pittsburgh)": "The Hill District is a historic black collection of neighborhoods in the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Beginning in the years leading up to World War I \"the Hill\" was the cultural center of black life in the city and a major center of jazz. Despite its cultural and economic vibrancy, in the mid-1950s a substantial area was slated for redevelopment, displacing about 80,000 individuals and leading to the neighborhood's dramatic economic decline."}}
