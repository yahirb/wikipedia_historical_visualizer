{"Bellevue": {"Red Square (University of Washington)": "Red Square, officially Central Plaza, is a large open square on the Seattle campus of the University of Washington that serves as a hub for two of the University's major axes, connecting the campus's northern Liberal Arts Quadrangle (\"The Quad\") with the science and engineering buildings found on the lower campus. The plaza is paved with red brick, and becomes notoriously slippery during precipitation.\nDuring the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, the square was the site for the temporary U.S. Government Building."}}
