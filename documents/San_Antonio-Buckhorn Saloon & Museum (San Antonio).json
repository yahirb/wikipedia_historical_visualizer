{"San_Antonio": {"Buckhorn Saloon & Museum (San Antonio)": "The Buckhorn Saloon & Museum is a privately run museum located at 318 E. Houston Street in Downtown San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Originally privately owned by Albert Friedrich, the Buckhorn became a tourist attraction for its unique collections. Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were reputed to frequent the establishment. Housed in 1956 in the Lone Star Brewery, the collection passed to Friedrich's heirs who had it moved to its current location."}}
