{"Camden": {"N3RD Street": "N3RD Street (also N3rd Street, N3RD St) is a nickname for a segment of North 3rd Street in Philadelphia, between Market Street and Girard Avenue (spanning across the neighborhoods of Old City and Northern Liberties), and its surrounding community that is home to a concentration of \"nerdy\" companies and spaces; \"N3RD\" is a double entendre as both leet for \"nerd\" and reflecting the \"N. 3rd St.\" of postal addresses.\nAn official resolution recognizing N3RD Street was adopted by Philadelphia's city council on March 20, 2014. Starting April 10, 2014, the city installed special street signs along the corridor denoting its nickname, similar to the neighborhood-specific signs in Chinatown and the Gayborhood."}}
