{"Davenport": {"McKinley Elementary School (Davenport, Iowa)": "McKinley Elementary School is located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa near the McClellan Heights Historic District. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 as a part of the Public Schools for Iowa: Growth and Change MPS.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Davenport Board of Education did an evaluation of its elementary school facilities in the 1920s as well as a study of the projected growth of the city and where that growth would take place. The projection was for the number of elementary-aged students to rise by almost three thousand students between 1930 and 1950, but no building plan based on these projections was prepared."}}
