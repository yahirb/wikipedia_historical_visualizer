{"Mount_Vernon": {"Neptune Island (Long Island Sound)": "Neptune Island was an island in Long Island Sound and part of the City of New Rochelle, New York. The island is connected to the mainland by stone causeway over which Neptune Road passes. A dam at the east end of the peninsula creates a small pond, while its west shore edges the Neptune Basin inlet."}}
