{"Cedar_Rapids": {"U.S. Cellular Center (Cedar Rapids)": "U.S. Cellular Center (formerly Five Seasons Center) is a multi-purpose arena located in the downtown area of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was financed by the approval of a voter referendum to allocate special municipal capital improvement bond monies, after several prior bond referendums to build a civic center failed between 1965 and 1977. The initial construction cost was approximately $7 million for the arena and facilities."}}
