{"Boston": {"King's Chapel": "King's Chapel is an independent Christian unitarian congregation affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association that is \"unitarian Christian in theology, Anglican in worship, and congregational in governance.\" It is housed in what was formerly called \"Stone Chapel\", an 18th-century structure at the corner of Tremont Street and School Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The chapel building, completed in 1754, is one of the finest designs of the noted colonial architect Peter Harrison, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its architectural significance.\nDespite its name, the adjacent King's Chapel Burying Ground is not affiliated with the chapel or any other church; it pre-dates the chapel by over a century."}}
