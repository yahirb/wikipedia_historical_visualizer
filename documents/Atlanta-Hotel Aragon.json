{"Atlanta": {"Hotel Aragon": "The Hotel Aragon was a six-story, 125-room hotel located 169 Peachtree Street NE, at the southeast corner of Ellis Street in Atlanta, in what is today the Peachtree Center area of downtown. It was a major addition to the city's hotel capacity at its completion in 1892, cost $250,000, and was built and owned by George Washington Collier. It was remarkable at the time as the only major hotel in the city not located adjacent to Union Station."}}
