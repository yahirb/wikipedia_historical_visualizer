{"Minneapolis": {"Ujamaa Place": "Ujamaa Place is a non-profit organization launched in 2009 to fill a gap in social welfare programming and services for African-American men between the ages of 17 and 28 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Ujamaa Place took over some of the services a previous program, Awali Place offered, when Awali lost its funding due to 2009 budget cuts."}}
