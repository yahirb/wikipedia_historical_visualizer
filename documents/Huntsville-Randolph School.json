{"Huntsville": {"Randolph School": "Randolph School is an American independent private kindergarten-through-12th-grade college preparatory school chartered in 1959 in Huntsville, Madison County, Alabama. It started in an antebellum home on Randolph Avenue in downtown Huntsville with just a few elementary classes. A few years later it moved to a much larger 17-acre (69,000 m2) campus on Drake Avenue, where it is now located, gradually adding grade levels until having a graduating high school class in the early 1970s."}}
