{"Atlanta": {"Five Points Plaza": "Five Points Plaza, also known as 40 Marietta Street and formerly known as First Federal Building, is a 17 storey, 73 m (240 ft) office building skyscraper in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was constructed in 1964 to house headquarters of the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Atlanta. Noted for an Oriental architectural design that stands out in Atlanta, the building is devoid of interior columns, making it one of the tallest post-tensioned concrete buildings in the United States at the time of its construction."}}
