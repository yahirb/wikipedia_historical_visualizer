The nine-story tall building is located directly across from Arkansas Children's Hospital on 5th street. Part of the Little Rock Housing Authority's jurisdiction, the building has become notorious for its poverty and crime and has been part of the effort to clean up Little Rock's notorious south-central side, which garnered 52 murders in 2012."}}
