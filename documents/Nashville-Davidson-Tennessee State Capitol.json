{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Tennessee State Capitol": "The Tennessee State Capitol, located in Nashville, Tennessee, is the home of the General Assembly of Tennessee (state legislature), the location of the governor's office, and a National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect William Strickland (1788-1854), of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Nashville, it is one of Nashville's most prominent examples of Greek Revival architecture. It is one of only twelve state capitols (along with those of Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, and Virginia) that does not have a dome."}}
