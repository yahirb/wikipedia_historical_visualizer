{"Quincy": {"Walton and Roslin Halls": "Walton and Roslin Halls is a mixed-used commercial and residential building that was built in two parts. They are located at the corner of Washington and Walton Streets in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, and extend south along Washington Street. The first of the two buildings, that at 3-5 Walton Street and 702-708 Washington, is a three-story brick and wood frame structure built in 1897 to a design by Cornelius A. Russell; the southern portion was completed a year later."}}
