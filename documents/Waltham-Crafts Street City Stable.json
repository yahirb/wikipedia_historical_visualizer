{"Waltham": {"Crafts Street City Stable": "The Crafts Street City Stable is an historic redbrick public works building located at 90 Crafts Street near Ashmont Avenue in Newton, Massachusetts. Designed for $375 by Boston-based architect and Newton resident William F. Goodwin in the Colonial Revival style of architecture, it was built in 1895 for the city of Newton at a cost of $25,000 to serve as additional stable for its then Highway Department. Over the years it was converted to a city garage and is now called the Crafts Street Garage and forms the focal point for the city's Department of Public Works complex."}}
