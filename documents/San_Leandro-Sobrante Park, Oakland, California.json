{"San_Leandro": {"Sobrante Park, Oakland, California": "Sobrante Park is a neighborhood located in East Oakland, California, which is partially separated from the rest of the city by two railroad tracks and San Leandro Creek. It was built shortly after World War II, first as a White-Only Lockout and then gradually becoming a White flight red-zone in the mid to late 50's, and in the early 60's it became a working-class black neighborhood. It was projected by planners that there would be no in-road into SanLeandro's Davis St."}}
