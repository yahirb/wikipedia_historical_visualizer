{"Camden": {"Dolley Todd House": "Dolley Payne Todd Madison (May 20, 1768 \u2013 July 12, 1849) was the wife of James Madison, President of the United States from 1809 to 1817. She was noted for her social graces, which boosted her husband\u2019s popularity as President. In this way, she did much to define the role of the President\u2019s spouse, known only much later by the title First Lady\u2014a function she had sometimes performed earlier for the widowed Thomas Jefferson."}}
