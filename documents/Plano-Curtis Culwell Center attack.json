{"Plano": {"Curtis Culwell Center attack": "The Curtis Culwell Center attack was carried out by two men who attacked officers with gunfire at the entrance to an exhibit featuring cartoon images of Muhammad at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015. The attackers shot a Garland Independent School District (GISD) security officer in the ankle. Shortly after the attackers pulled up and opened fire, both were shot and wounded by a police officer (who was wrongly credited with killing the two men in initial news reports). The attackers were eventually killed by four members of a SWAT team.\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack plot, the first time the militant group took credit for an attack in the United States. ISIL's claim of responsibility has not been verified, and U.S. officials stated that the attack appears to have been inspired, but not directed, by ISIL."}}
