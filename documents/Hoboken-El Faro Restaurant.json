{"Hoboken": {"El Faro Restaurant": "El Faro Restaurant was a small Spanish food emporium located at 823 Greenwich Street in Manhattan, New York's West Village since it opened in 1927. The restaurant shuttered in 2012 after failing to raise over $80,000 to pay off fines and expenses.\nIts first set of owners, Manuel Rivas and Edwardo Cabana, ran the establishment as a Spanish bar and grill."}}
