{"Fayetteville": {"David and Mary Margaret Durst House": "The David and Mary Margaret Durst House is a historic house at 857 Fairview Drive in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a post-and-beam structure, long and narrow, which is in places cantilevered over a concrete foundation poured in board forms that left vertical marks in the concrete. The building has a flat tar and gravel roof, unusual at the time of its construction for residential architecture."}}
