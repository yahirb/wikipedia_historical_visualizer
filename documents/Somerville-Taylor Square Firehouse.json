{"Somerville": {"Taylor Square Firehouse": "The Taylor Square Firehouse is an historic fire station at 113 Garden Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The stylistically eclectic brick building was built in 1904 to a design by local architect Charles Greco. Although it has a somewhat standard building plan dictated by its function, the building has exotic architectural details, including a projecting cornice with large wooden brackets, patterned brickwork on the parapet, and Moorish Revival decoration of the truck bay arches."}}
