It is owned by Cumulus Media.\n\n\n== History ==\nWLTO originally signed on the air in 1988 as an urban contemporary outlet with the call letters WCKU (U102), but by the early 1994 they would flip to classic rock as WLRO, only to switch directions to oldies as WLTO. In 2001, the station flipped to classic country as \"US 102.\" The WLTO calls remained on the station."}}
