{"Providence": {"Cathedral of St. John (Providence, Rhode Island)": "Providence is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Rhode Island and is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle."}}
