{"San_Mateo": {"USAT General Frank M. Coxe": "The General Frank M. Coxe is a steam ferry which was built for the United States Army to provide transportation services among several military facilities that ring California's San Francisco Bay.\nThe 144-foot (44 m) ship's keel was laid on July 16, 1921, launched March 3, 1922, and delivered December 1, 1922, to the War Department by Charles Ward Engineering Works. Coxe and sister-ship USAT General John McE. Hyde were designed and built shortly after World War I to ferry army personnel to island bases in strategic harbors, in answer to the increasing military importance of the Pacific ports."}}
