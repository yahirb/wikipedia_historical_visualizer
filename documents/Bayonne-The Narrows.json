{"Bayonne": {"The Narrows": "The Narrows is the tidal strait separating the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. It connects the Upper New York Bay and Lower New York Bay and forms the principal channel by which the Hudson River empties into the Atlantic Ocean. It has long been considered to be the maritime \"gateway\" to New York City and historically has been one of the most important entrances into the harbors of the Port of New York and New Jersey."}}
