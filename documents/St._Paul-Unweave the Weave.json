{"St._Paul": {"Unweave the Weave": "Unweave the Weave was a $120-million road construction project that reconstructed the interchanges of Interstate 694 and Interstate 35E in Little Canada and Vadnais Heights, Minnesota. The project sought to eliminate unnecessary lane changes by having all entrances and exits to the highway occur on the same side of the road. The project began in mid 2004 and ended in late 2008."}}
