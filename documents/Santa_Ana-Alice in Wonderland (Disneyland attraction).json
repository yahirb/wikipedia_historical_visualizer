{"Santa_Ana": {"Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)": "Alice in Wonderland is a dark ride in Fantasyland at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Based on the animated Disney adaptation of the same name, the attraction resides next to a second ride, the Mad Tea Party, based on a scene in that same adaptation.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginal plans for Disneyland show that there was supposed to be an \"Alice in Wonderland\" walk-through attraction in 1955, but time and budgetary restrictions forced planners to defer the attraction and the designated space was instead occupied by the Fantasyland Theater (now the location of \"Pinocchio's Daring Journey\")."}}
