{"Dearborn": {"Riverfront Bike Trail": "The Roy A. Battagello River Walk Bike Trail is the current backbone of the \"Windsor Loop\" bike trail network in Windsor, Ontario. The bike trail travels from the foot of the Ambassador Bridge (at Peter Street and Huron Church Road), to traffic lights at Riverside Drive and Lincoln Avenue (continuing as bike lanes to George Avenue and Wyandotte Street, for a total distance of 8.0 km (5.0 mi)). This makes the trail the second-longest trail in the City of Windsor (the longest being the mostly-unpaved West Windsor Recreationway), at 8.0 km."}}
