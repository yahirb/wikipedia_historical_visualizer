{"West_Allis": {"Washington Monument (Milwaukee)": "The Washington Monument is a public artwork by American artist Richard Henry Park located on the Court of Honor, which is near Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The bronze sculpture is a full-length portrait of a 43-year-old George Washington, and stands on a granite pedestal; a bronze woman points up at Washington while a child, also made out of bronze, gazes upward. It was sculpted by Richard Henry Park and was erected in 1885 with philanthropic financial support from Elizabeth Plankinton."}}
