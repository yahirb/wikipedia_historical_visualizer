{"Champaign": {"Busey\u2013Evans Residence Halls": "The Busey\u2013Evans Residence Halls, historically known as the Women's Residence Hall and the West Residence Hall respectively, are historic dormitories at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. Busey Hall was built in 1916, while Evans Hall was built in 1926; a connector wing links the two buildings, and they are considered part of the same dormitory complex. James A. White designed Busey Hall, while Charles A. Platt designed Evans Hall; both architects played an important role in designing other buildings on the university's campus, and both chose the Georgian Revival style for their designs to match the campus's architectural theme."}}
