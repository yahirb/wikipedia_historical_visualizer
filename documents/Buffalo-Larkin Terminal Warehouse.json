{"Buffalo": {"Larkin Terminal Warehouse": "The Larkin Terminal Warehouse also known as Larkin at Exchange or the Larkin R/S/T Building  is located at 726 Exchange Street, Buffalo, New York in a neighborhood known as the \"Hydraulics\". The neighborhood was one of Buffalo's earliest industrial districts and it derived its name from the construction of a small hydraulic canal. The building, clearly visible from the I-190 interstate, was originally part of the Larkin Company and was one of the last constructed buildings in the complex."}}
