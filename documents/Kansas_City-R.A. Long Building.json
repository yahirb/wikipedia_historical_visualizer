{"Kansas_City": {"R.A. Long Building": "In 1906, R.A. Long's Long-Bell Lumber Company had outgrown the office space in the Keith & Perry Building. Expanding operations and the need for a larger headquarters resulted in the construction of the R.A. Long Building, completed in 1907. This was the first all-steel framed building in Kansas City, Missouri with 16 stories and over 600 offices."}}
