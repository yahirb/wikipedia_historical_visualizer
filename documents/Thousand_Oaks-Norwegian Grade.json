{"Thousand_Oaks": {"Norwegian Grade": "The Norwegian Grade is a 2 miles (3.2 km) section of Moorpark Road from the Santa Rosa Valley up into the Simi Hills and the city of Thousand Oaks, within Ventura County, California. Completed in 1911, it may be one of the Norwegian Colony's most notable contributions to the city.\nUntil the construction of California State Route 23 Freeway, this was the most direct route between Moorpark and Thousand Oaks for automobile and truck traffic."}}
