{"Bellevue": {"Howard House (Seattle)": "Howard House was a contemporary art gallery located in the historic Pioneer Square District in Downtown Seattle. From its inception in 1997 to its closing on June 12, 2010, the gallery fostered the careers of several local, national and international artists. Billy Howard, the gallery's owner, cited slow business as the basis for the decision."}}
