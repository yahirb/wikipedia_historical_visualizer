{"Pittsburgh": {"Brew House Association": "The Brew House Association is an artist collective established in 1991 in the South Side Flats neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located at Mary and 21st Streets in a multi-story building that once housed the Duquesne Brewing Company. The lower floors of the building have been converted to gallery and theater space, including SPACE 101, an alternative exhibit gallery founded by the Brew House Association in 1994, while the upper floors have become studio and living areas for resident artists, and shared workshops for welding and pottery."}}
