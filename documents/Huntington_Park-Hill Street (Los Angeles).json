{"Huntington_Park": {"Hill Street (Los Angeles)": "Bunker Hill is a historic prominence that traditionally separated Downtown Los Angeles from the rest of the city to the west before the hill was tunneled through at Second Street in 1924.\nIn the late 20th century, the hill was lowered in elevation, and the entire area was redeveloped to supplant old frame and concrete buildings with modern high-rises and other structures for residences, commerce, entertainment and education. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is also on Bunker Hill."}}
