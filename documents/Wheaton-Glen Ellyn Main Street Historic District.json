{"Wheaton": {"Glen Ellyn Main Street Historic District": "The Glen Ellyn Main Street Historic District is a set of eleven buildings in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The houses were built between 1874 and 1890 when the village was known as Prospect Park. The swampy setting of the village began to gain a reputation as a retreat away from the city, and by 1882 the village was large enough for incorporation."}}
