{"Duluth": {"Thomas Wilson (shipwreck)": "The Thomas Wilson was a whaleback freighter built in 1892 and used to haul bulk freight on the Great Lakes. The ship sank just outside the harbor of Duluth, Minnesota, on Lake Superior, on 7 June 1902, after a collision with the George Hadley. The Thomas Wilson is one of the best remaining examples of a whaleback steamer, and it is also significant for the changes made in operating procedures at the Duluth harbor."}}
