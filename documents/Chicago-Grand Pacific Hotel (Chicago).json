{"Chicago": {"Grand Pacific Hotel (Chicago)": "The Grand Pacific Hotel (1873\u20131895) was one of the first two prominent hotels built in Chicago, Illinois, after the Great Chicago Fire. The hotel, designed by William W. Boyington and managed for more than 20 years by John Drake, was located on the block bounded by Clark Street, LaSalle, Quincy and Jackson.\nDrake hosted \"Great Game Dinners\" featuring exotic cuisines at this hotel. These dinners were a Chicago social institution for more than 50 years. Newspapers devoted 4 inches to its menu and guests.\nAlong with contemporary Chicago luxury hotels such as the Palmer House, Tremont House, and Sherman House, it was built in the palazzo architectural style of the day. The hotel also accommodated wealthy permanent residents in addition to transient guests who enjoyed the palace hotel.\n\nIt was the site where Standard time was adopted on October 11, 1883.\nMany notable celebrities stayed here, including Oscar Wilde on his first visit to Chicago as part of his 1882 lecture tour of America. James A. Garfield stayed at the hotel during the 1880 Republican National Convention, during which time he was nominated on the 34th ballot to represent the party in the election for President of the United States.\nA later Grand Pacific Hotel (1895/8\u20131921) opened March 12, 1898, with 188 rooms."}}
