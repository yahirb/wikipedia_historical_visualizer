{"Little_Rock": {"Capitol\u2013Main Historic District": "The Capitol\u2013Main Historic District encompasses a well-preserved area of early 19th-century commercial architecture in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. The district includes 2-1/2 blocks of Capitol Street, extending east from Center Street, one block of Main Street south of Capitol, and one block of 6th Street west of Main. The buildings in this area were mostly built before World War II, and are of a more modest scale than modern sections of the downtown."}}
