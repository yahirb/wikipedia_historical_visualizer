{"Mount_Vernon": {"Church of the Good Shepherd (New York City)": "The Church of the Good Shepherd, located at 4967 Broadway at the corner of Isham Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, is a Roman Catholic parish church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. It was built in 1935-36 and was designed by Paul Monaghan in the Romanesque Revival style. The Celtic cross at the top of the church is an indication that the parish was originally largely Irish-American; today there are more Dominican-Americans than Irish."}}
