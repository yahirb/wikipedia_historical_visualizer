{"Milwaukee": {"Lake Park, Milwaukee": "Lake Park, located on Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is an urban park covering 138.1-acre (559,000 m2).\n\n\n== Design ==\nLake Park was designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Central Park in New York City along with many others. Believing that access to nature had a civilizing and restorative effect on the urban public, Olmsted designed Lake Park in the Romantic tradition, with a preference for natural (over formal) landscaping, winding paths, a variety of vistas, incorporation of wildlife, and a balance between active recreation and more passive enjoyment."}}
