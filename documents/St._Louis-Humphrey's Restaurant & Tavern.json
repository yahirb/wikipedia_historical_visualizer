{"St._Louis": {"Humphrey's Restaurant & Tavern": "Humphrey's Restaurant & Tavern (also referred to as Humphrey's or Hump's) is a college bar near Saint Louis University, at Laclede and Spring Streets, that was the basis for the 2001 film One Night at McCool's, written by Stan Seidel, but the movie was not shot here as it was considered not appropriate for filming. Seidel, who died just prior to the film's debut, was a frequent customer at Humphrey's before writing the film.\nThe tavern opened on June 18, 1976, and is named after its owner, Robert \"Humphrey\" Mangelsdorf."}}
