{"Bellevue": {"Beacon Hill Branch Library": "The Beacon Hill Branch Library is a branch of the Seattle Public Library in the Beacon Hill neighborhood.\nBeacon Hill is one of five branches, all south of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, that saw declining use in the 2010s, possibly because job-seekers in the city's less affluent southern half had been using libraries during Seattle's 2008-2012 recession.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeacon Hill Branch was housed in a number of locations, including a location at 2519 15th Avenue South converted to a library in 1962."}}
