{"Chicago": {"Chez Paul": "Chez Paul was a French restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Established in 1945 by Paul Contos, Chez Paul became famous under Paul's son, Bill. When it was open, it was the oldest French restaurant in Chicago, and was only exceeded in prestige by Le Francais (which is also closed.)\nBill Contos died in April 1993 and though the restaurant was struggling, his wife, Regina kept it open for a few more years, long enough to see its 50th anniversary."}}
