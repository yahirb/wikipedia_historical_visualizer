{"Palo_Alto": {"Kepler's Books": "Kepler's Books and Magazines is an independent bookstore in Menlo Park, California. It was founded on May 14, 1955 by Roy Kepler, who had previously been a staff member of the Berkeley listener-supported radio station KPFA. It \"soon blossomed into a cultural epicenter and attracted loyal customers from the students and faculty of Stanford University and from other members of the surrounding communities who were interested in serious books and ideas.\"\n\n\n== Sixties counterculture ==\nJohn Markoff in his 2005 text, What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry referenced Kepler's as an important meeting point for the Counterculture of the 1960s. The Palo Alto Weekly also noted that, \"through the 60s and 70s, the culture of Kepler's began to evolve into a broader counter-culture."}}
