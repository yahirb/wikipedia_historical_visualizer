{"Waltham": {"Glen Road Historic District": "The Glen Road Historic District is a historic district at 233-317 Glen Road in Weston, Massachusetts. The district encapsulates historical development trends in Weston, in which land began in agricultural uses, and was later transformed into either resort or suburban residential housing. It is also notable for its longtime association with the Jennings family, who owned the land from the 18th century into the 20th, and engaged in all three land uses."}}
