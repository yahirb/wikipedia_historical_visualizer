{"Cupertino": {"McClellan Ranch Park": "McClellan Ranch Park is a 23-acre (93,000 m2) public park located in the Monta Vista neighborhood of Cupertino that still retains its rural ranch look. It used to be a horse ranch owed by the McClellan family in the 1930s, and still preserves the original ranch house, a working milk barn and livestock barn, and two historical structures moved from other sites, along with a natural reserve in the middle of the park. A famous birding hot spot, the ranch park also houses the headquarters of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society and a nature museum and environmental education center."}}
