{"North_Charleston": {"Dr. Henry Frost Office": "The Dr. Henry Frost Office at 98 Broad Street is composed of a front portion that appears to date from the mid-19th century and a rear portion that appears to be much older. The land upon which 98 Broad Street was built was owned by famous loyalist and horticulturalist Alexander Garden when he was forced to abandon the property when Charleston fell to the colonial forces in 1782."}}
