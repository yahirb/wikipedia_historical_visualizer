{"Cambridge": {"Building 20": "Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since it was always regarded as \"temporary\", it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence. The three-floor structure housed the Radiation Laboratory (or \"Rad Lab\"), where fundamental advances were made in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and which has been called one of \"two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war\"."}}
