{"North_Little_Rock": {"Over-the-Jumps Carousel": "The Over-the-Jumps Carousel, also known as the Herschell-Spillman Carousel is a historic carousel at the Little Rock Zoo in Little Rock, Arkansas. Built in the 1920s and first exhibited at the 1924 Arkansas State Fair, it is believed to be the last operating \"over-the-jumps\" carousel in the world, with an original undulating wooden platform mounted on a 1960s-vintage caterpillar drive. The horses were carved by the Allan Herschell Company."}}
