{"Minneapolis": {"Northeast, Minneapolis": "Northeast is a defined community in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, composed of 13 smaller neighborhoods whose street addresses end in \"NE\". Unofficially it also includes the neighborhoods of the University community which have \"NE\" addresses, and the entirety of the Old Saint Anthony business district, which sits on the dividing line of \"NE\" and \"SE\" addresses. In the wider community, this business district, which is the oldest settlement in the city, is often identified as the heart of Northeast, in part because it lies across the Mississippi River from Downtown Minneapolis."}}
