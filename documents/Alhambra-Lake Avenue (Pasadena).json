{"Alhambra": {"Lake Avenue (Pasadena)": "Lake Avenue is a major north\u2013south feeder road for the Pasadena and Altadena communities in Los Angeles County, California. The road was developed in the mid 19th century and takes its name from a lake which was located at its southernmost end known variously as Mission Lake, Kewen Lake, and Wilson Lake reflecting different owners of the land. The lake bed still exists as a municipal park (Lacey Park) in the City of San Marino just south of the Raymond Dike, but it holds no water."}}
