{"Cambridge": {"Theodore W. Richards House": "The Theodore W. Richards House is a National Historic Landmark at 15 Follen Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built in 1900, it was the home until his death of Theodore William Richards (1868-1928), the first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Richards was a leading experimental chemist of his day, measuring (as precisely as instruments of the day permitted) the atomic weights of a large number of elements."}}
