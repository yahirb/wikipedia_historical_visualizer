{"Boston": {"Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court": "The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) is the highest court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The SJC claims the distinction of being the oldest continuously functioning appellate court in the Americas, with a recognized history dating to the establishment of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature in 1692 under the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania disputes this, claiming to be eight years older.\nAlthough it was historically composed of four associate justices and one chief justice, the court is currently composed of six associate justices and one chief justice.\n\n"}}
