{"New_Rochelle": {"Horseshoe Harbor (Long Island Sound)": "Horseshoe Harbor is the name of a bay located on the north shore of Long Island Sound, in the village of Larchmont in Westchester County, New York. This small cove lies just westward of Larchmont Harbor and is used as a launch anchorage for small recreational boats. The deeper water in the entrance favors the eastern side, and the northwest side of the cove is bare at low tide."}}
