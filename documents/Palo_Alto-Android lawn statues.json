{"Palo_Alto": {"Android lawn statues": "The Android lawn statues are a series of large foam statues near the Googleplex (Google's headquarters) in Mountain View, California, currently located at 1981 Landings Drive. They are based on the code names for versions of Google's Android mobile operating system, which are named after desserts and sweet treats. These statues were originally located in front of Building 44, where the Android development team had its offices, before being moved to their present location a few blocks away next to the Google Visitor Center Beta."}}
