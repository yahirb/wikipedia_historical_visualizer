{"Fall_River": {"Sakonnet River rail bridge": "The Sakonnet River rail bridge was a swing bridge that spanned the Sakonnet River between Portsmouth and Tiverton, Rhode Island, connecting Aquidneck Island to the mainland. It was built in 1899 by the Pennsylvania Steel Company, replacing a previous crossing constructed when the Newport and Fall River Railroad opened in 1864.\nThe bridge served a succession of railroads; the Providence and Worcester Railroad took over the line in 1982."}}
