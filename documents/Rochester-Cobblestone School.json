{"Rochester": {"Cobblestone School": "Cobblestone is a natural building material based on cobble-sized stones, and is used for pavement roads, streets, and buildings.\nIn England, it was commonplace since ancient times for flat stones with a flat narrow edge to be set on edge to provide an even paved surface. This was known as a 'pitched' surface and was common all over Britain, as it did not require rounded pebbles."}}
