{"New_York": {"The Great Saunter": "The Great Saunter is a day long hike that explores Manhattan\u2019s 32-mile shoreline, visiting more than 20 parks and promenades of Manhattan Island. Manhattan's waterfront rim has evolved since Shorewalkers Inc., a non-profit environmental and walking group, began fighting for a public shoreline walkway in 1982. Now the path is nearly contiguous."}}
