{"Newport_Beach": {"Linda Isle, Newport Beach": "Linda Isle is a part of the Lower Bay of Newport Beach, California. In 1954, Linda Isle became the last to be incorporated into the city of Newport Beach, and it was in this period that the entire city, including the islands, began to change from a resort to a residential community. Linda Island is laid out in the shape of a horseshoe, and each home has its own private dock."}}
