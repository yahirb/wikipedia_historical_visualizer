{"Stamford": {"New Canaan High School": "New Canaan High School is the only public high school in New Canaan, Connecticut. The current Principal is William Egan. The school is a part of the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, otherwise known as the FCIAC.\nLike many high schools in rich areas, vaping is seen as an issue here. A few months ago, an email sent out to the alumni stated that students have been expelled for doing so in the building.  Additionally, on the school blog, the principal occasionally posts articles against vaping to raise awareness on the issue."}}
