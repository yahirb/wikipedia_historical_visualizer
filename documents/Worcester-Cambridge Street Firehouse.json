{"Worcester": {"Cambridge Street Firehouse": "The Cambridge Street Firehouse is a historic fire station at 534 Cambridge Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The two story brick building was built in 1886 in a Queen Anne style, with some Romanesque details. It is nearly identical to Worcester's Woodland Street Firehouse; both were designed by Fuller & Delano and built the same year."}}
