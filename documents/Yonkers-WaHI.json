{"Yonkers": {"WaHI": "WaHI stands for \"Washington Heights and Inwood,\" two neighborhoods of Upper Manhattan in New York City. The term was coined by Eduardo G\u00f3mez, founder of the WaHI Online community web site, in 2002. The term is commonly used and understood within WaHI Online, but has not caught on widely elsewhere (as opposed to, for example, Hudson Heights, which was chosen by a group of neighborhood activistsand is widely cited)."}}
