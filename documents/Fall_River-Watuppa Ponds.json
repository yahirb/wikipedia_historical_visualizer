{"Fall_River": {"Watuppa Ponds": "The Watuppa Ponds are two large, naturally occurring, spring-fed, glacially formed ponds located in Fall River and Westport, Massachusetts. Watuppa is a native word meaning \"place of boats\". The two ponds were originally one body of water (originally one lake), connected by a narrow rocky straight called \"The Narrows\" located on a thin strip of land between the two ponds which forms part boundary of between Fall River and Westport."}}
