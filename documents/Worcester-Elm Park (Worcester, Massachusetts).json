{"Worcester": {"Elm Park (Worcester, Massachusetts)": "Elm Park is an historic park in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nThe land the park resides on was purchased in 1854, making it one of the first public purchases of land expressly intended for use as a municipal park in the United States, after Bushnell Park in Hartford, purchased earlier that year. (This is not to be confused with the oldest public park, Boston Common, established in 1634.)\nElm Park originally consisted of the land bordered by Park Avenue, Russell Street, Elm Street and Highland Street."}}
