{"Jersey_City": {"109 Washington Street": "109 Washington Street is a five-story tenement on the Lower West Side of Manhattan in New York City, within the area once known as Little Syria. Due to demolitions connected to the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the World Trade Center, it stands as the last tenement on a portion of lower Washington Street that has been estimated by Kate Reggev to have contained around 50 tenements. After September 11, 2001, its proximity to the World Trade Center site made it the subject of some media attention, including a nationally syndicated radio story about the experiences of its residents on the day of the attack."}}
