Taylor between 1973 and 1975, the work was funded by TriMet and the United States Department of Transportation and was installed on the Transit Mall in 1977. The following year Kvinneakt appeared in the \"Expose Yourself to Art\" poster which featured future Mayor of Portland Bud Clark flashing the sculpture."}}
