{"Miami": {"Picnic Islands": "The Picnic Islands are a small group of islands within the city of Miami, Florida, United States. They are located just north of Biscayne Island in Biscayne Bay, just east offshore from the Edgewater and Upper Eastside districts of the city. The islands are uninhabited, but several of the group have beaches where boaters and picnicers frequent."}}
