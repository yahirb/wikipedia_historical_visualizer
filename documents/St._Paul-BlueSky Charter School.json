{"St._Paul": {"BlueSky Charter School": "BlueSky was the first charter school in Minnesota to be completely online, following on from Mindquest, which was the first online public high school. When BlueSky opened, a law was passed that made online schools have to spend at least two days per week in a traditional classroom with a teacher, but BlueSky was already completely online so it was allowed to stay. The law was later repealed."}}
