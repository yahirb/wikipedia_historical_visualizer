{"Revere": {"Gridley Street Historic District": "The Gridley Street Historic District is a one-square-block commercial historic district on the edge of the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. It is bounded by High, Pearl, Purchase and Congress Streets, and was developed in the aftermath of the Great Boston Fire of 1872. The district includes the previously-listed Richardson Block, as well as the Henry Willis Building (169-177 Purchase Street), both built immediately after the fire, as well as the Western Union Building (a 1930 Art Deco high-rise), and the Bradley and Woodruff Block, a Romanesque Revival structure."}}
