{"Fort_Smith": {"Angus McLeod House": "The Angus McLeod House was a historic house at 912 North 13th Street in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Built in 1905, it was a handsome Classical Revival structure, built out of pink brick with a stone foundation, that rose to include piers for an elaborate front portico supported by Corinthian columns. The house was one of the most expensive and elaborate built in Fort Smith at the time, with interior decoration matching its exterior in lavish detail."}}
