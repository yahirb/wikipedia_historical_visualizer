{"Stamford": {"Greenwich Y.M.C.A.": "The Greenwich Y.M.C.A. is a historic building at 50 East Putnam Avenue in Greenwich, Connecticut. It was designed by M.L. and H.G. Emory, two virtually unknown architects, and built in 1916 in Colonial Revival / Georgian Revival style with Beaux Arts flourishes. Occupying the corner of East Putnam and Mason Street, the building is centered on the corner, where there is a central rotunda from which four-story rectangular wings extend, with a large gymnasium/swimming pool complex behind. The rotunda rises above the hip roofs of the wings, topped by a shallow dome and octagonal cupola.\nThe building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996."}}
