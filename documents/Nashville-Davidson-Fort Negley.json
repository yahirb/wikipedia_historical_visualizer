{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Fort Negley": "Fort Negley was a fortification built by Union troops after the capture of Nashville, Tennessee during the American Civil War, located approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) south of the city center. It was the largest inland fort built in the United States during the war.\n\n\n== History ==\nOnce Confederate forces were routed in February, 1862, from Forts Henry and Donelson (on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively), Confederate commanders decided that any further effort in the defense of Nashville would be pointless, and they abandoned any attempt to keep Nashville behind their lines."}}
