{"Medford": {"Albree-Hall-Lawrence House": "The Albree-Hall-Lawrence House is a historic house located at 353 Lawrence Road in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe 2.5-story wood frame house has a somewhat complex construction history, which may date to the early years of the 18th century. Its foundations give evidence of at least three periods of construction prior to 1850, and it is known that a house was standing at this one's approximate site in 1720, when John Albree purchased the farm and house."}}
