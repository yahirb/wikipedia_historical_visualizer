{"Jersey_City": {"Weehawken Street": "Weehawken Street is a short street located in New York City's West Village, in the borough of Manhattan, one block from and parallel to West and Washington Streets, running between Christopher Street and West 10th Street.\nThe land around Weehawken Street was at one time part of Newgate State Prison, built in 1796-97, until the prison was closed and razed and the city in 1829 sold the prison property off in lots. It held on to a strip of property, creating Weehawken Street and opening a produce market on the site, building the Market House in 1834."}}
