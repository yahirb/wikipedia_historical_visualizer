{"Lakewood": {"Garfield Building (Cleveland)": "The Garfield Building is an 1898-built 150 foot 13 story high-rise on the corner of Euclid and East Sixth Street across the street from the future 515 Euclid Avenue skyscraper in downtown Cleveland's East 4th Street. The edifice was built by two of President James A. Garfield's sons and it was 11 stories when first erected but two more stories were added later. The Garfield is notable for being the headquarters of NatCity Investments which went bankrupt in the 2008 financial meltdown on Wall Street."}}
