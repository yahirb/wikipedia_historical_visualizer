{"Modesto": {"Modesto Arch": "The Modesto Arch is a centennial slogan arch, built in 1912, to welcome automobile drivers to Modesto, California where it currently stands at the intersection of 9th and I Streets. The arch bears the city's motto, \"Water, Wealth, Contentment, Health\", illuminated by 696 incandescent lightbulbs.\nThe original first-place slogan was \"Nobody's Got Modesto's Goat\", which was later rejected, and the second-place slogan was used instead."}}
