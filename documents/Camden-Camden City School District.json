{"Camden": {"Camden City School District": "Camden City School District is a public school district that serves students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade from the city of Camden, in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide, which are now referred to as \"SDA Districts\" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. In 2013, after years of requests from local officials, New Jersey intervened in Camden City, making the school district state-run under the leadership of Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard."}}
