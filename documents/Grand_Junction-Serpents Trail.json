{"Grand_Junction": {"Serpents Trail": "The Serpents Trail in Colorado National Monument, also known as the Trail of the Serpents and the Serpentine Trail, was built by the visionary John Otto, who began the campaign to establish the national monument. The trail was, in fact, a road from Grand Junction, Colorado through No Thoroughfare Canyon to the rimrock near Cold Shivers Point, with an elevation gain of nearly 1100 feet over 2.5 miles. From Cold Shivers Point the road proceeded at a gentler grade for four miles to Glade Park."}}
