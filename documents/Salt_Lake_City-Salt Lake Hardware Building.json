{"Salt_Lake_City": {"Salt Lake Hardware Building": "The Salt Lake Hardware Building is a converted warehouse building, located at 155 N 400 West in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1996, with the help of FFKR Architects, it was converted to office space for Albertsons operations, but currently it is vacant. The design was special in that it allowed the building to maintain the historic aspects."}}
