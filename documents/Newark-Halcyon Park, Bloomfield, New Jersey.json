{"Newark": {"Halcyon Park, Bloomfield, New Jersey": "Halcyon Park is an unincorporated community that was developed by Reverend Cyrus Kemper Capron in Bloomfield, in Essex County, New Jersey, United States, in 1895 as a planned community of homes with trees and shrubs, picturesque cottages, ponds and common grounds to be maintained by a caretaker and gardener. It is believed that Halcyon Park was inspired by Llewellyn Park, the first planned garden suburb about three miles away. Capron envisioned a private residential park for individuals of moderate means to offer all the advantages of the city (proximity to two railroads and a trolley for access to Newark and New York City, water, gas sewer and paved streets) and the country (trees, ponds, picturesque landscape)."}}
