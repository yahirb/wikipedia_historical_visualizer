{"Hoboken": {"Dia Art Foundation": "Dia Art Foundation is a nonprofit organization that initiates, supports, presents, and preserves art projects. It was established in 1974 as the Lone Star Foundation, by Philippa de Menil, the daughter of Houston arts patron Dominique de Menil and an heiress to the Schlumberger oil exploration fortune; art dealer Heiner Friedrich, Philippa's husband; and Helen Winkler, a Houston art historian. Dia wanted to support projects \"whose nature or scale would preclude other funding sources.\"\nThe name \"Dia\", taken from the Greek word meaning \"through\", was chosen to suggest the institution's role in enabling artistic projects that might not otherwise be realized."}}
