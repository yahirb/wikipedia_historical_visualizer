{"Minneapolis": {"Wesley United Methodist Church (Minneapolis, Minnesota)": "The Wesley United Methodist Church (formerly the Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church) building was constructed of granite, stone, brick, and sandstone in Richardsonian Romanesque style, featuring round-arched windows and multiple towers. When built, the building was in the residential neighborhood of Loring Park at 101 Grant Street East; it was built during Minneapolis' building boom in the last decade of the 19th century. Architect Warren H. Hayes (1847\u20131899) was Minneapolis' leading designer of churches in the 19th century, having designed the Calvary Baptist Church, Fowler Methodist Episcopal Church, and the First Congregational Church, as well as the Central Presbyterian Church in Saint Paul."}}
