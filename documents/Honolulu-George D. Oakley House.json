{"Honolulu": {"George D. Oakley House": "The George D. Oakley House at 2110 Kakela Place in Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi, was built in 1929 in the English Cottage style of architecture popular in Hawai\u02bbi during the 1920s and 1930s. This house is one of the finest of only two dozen or so extant houses of similar style in the state. Signature elements of the style include asymmetrical massing, a roof shaped to resemble thatch, a gable with half-timbered facade, a king post truss ceiling, diamond-shaped casement windows, decorative as well as functional wrought iron, and even a tiny window in the chimney."}}
