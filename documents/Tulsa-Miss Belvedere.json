{"Tulsa": {"Miss Belvedere": "Miss Belvedere is a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere that was sealed in an underground vault on the grounds of the Tulsa city courthouse on June 15, 1957 as a 50-year time capsule.\nThe car, a desert gold and sand dune white two-tone sport coupe which displayed only four miles on its odometer, was entombed as part of the city of Tulsa's \"Tulsarama\" Golden Jubilee Week festivities celebrating Oklahoma's 50th year of statehood. The unnamed vehicle was intended to be a prize awarded upon the vehicle's unearthing to the individual, or their descendant, who came nearest to guessing Tulsa's population in 2007. A matching automobile had been awarded in a separate contest a few days prior.\nNicknamed the Miss Belvedere by a member of the committee organizing the 2007 event, she was unearthed on June 14, 2007 during the state's centennial celebration and publicly unveiled the next day. Reflecting the Cold War tensions pandemic in late 1950s America, the enclosure \u2013 built of poured in place concrete and sprayed with pneumatically applied gunite \u2013 was advertised as having been built to withstand a nuclear attack. However, the vault was breached by long term water intrusion, that submerged the entire vehicle, causing significant cosmetic and structural damage.\nEfforts were made to stabilize Miss Belvedere's condition, including essential suspension repairs, with the hope placing her in a museum. After being stored for ten years, she was accepted by the Historic Auto Attractions Museum in Roscoe, Illinois and shipped in June 2017."}}
