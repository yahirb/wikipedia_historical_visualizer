{"Kenner": {"Duncan Canal (Louisiana)": "The Duncan Canal, also known as the West Return Canal, is a canal in Louisiana, running along a sizable portion of the boundary between Jefferson Parish, Louisiana and St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The primary purpose of the canal is drainage; a series of pumps and feeder canals feed a portion of the rain and ground water of the East Bank of Jefferson into the canal which drains it into Lake Pontchartrain."}}
