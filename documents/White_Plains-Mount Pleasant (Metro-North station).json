{"White_Plains": {"Mount Pleasant (Metro-North station)": "The Mount Pleasant Metro-North Railroad station serves two adjacent cemeteries (Gate of Heaven and Kensico, the latter of which had its own station until the mid-1980s) and an adjacent funeral home in Hawthorne, New York via the Harlem Line. There is one train in each direction on weekdays and three trains in each direction on weekends. The station exists largely for visitors of those buried in the cemetery, in turn there is no parking available at this station and it is not intended as a commuter station."}}
