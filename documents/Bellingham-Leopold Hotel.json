{"Bellingham": {"Leopold Hotel": "The Leopold in Bellingham, Washington was built in 1889 and originally named the Byron Hotel after its owner Captain H.C. Byron. Byron owned the hotel until 1910 when Leopold F. Schmidt (founder of the Olympia Brewing Company and owner of the Bellingham Bay Brewery) purchased the Byron for $100,000. One famous fact about the hotel was the home (off and on) of famous Alaskan artist Sydney Laurence; however given his economic situation, he was unable to pay his bill in cash so instead traded Schmidt paintings for his room."}}
