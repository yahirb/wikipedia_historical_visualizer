{"Newton": {"House at 68 Maple Street": "The House at 68 Maple Street is an historic building located on the corner of Maple Street and Nonantum Road in the village of Newton Corner, in Newton, Massachusetts. Built in the late 1840s, the two-story wood-frame building is a rare local example of a vernacular square hip-roofed Italianate house. Its most prominent feature are its overscaled brackets, which decorate both the extended eaves and the roof line of the bay on the front facade."}}
