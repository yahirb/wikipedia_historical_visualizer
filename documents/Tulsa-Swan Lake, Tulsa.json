{"Tulsa": {"Swan Lake, Tulsa": "Swan Lake is a historic district in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its borders consist of 15th Street to the North, Utica Street to the East, 21st Street to the South, and Peoria Avenue to the west. The District was developed in the early 20th Century as a middle class residential area with single-family homes, some duplexes and apartment buildings. It is still considered a highly regarded residential area with a high occupancy rate.\nThe district presently covers about 127 acres (51 ha) and includes 415 contributing resources and 148 non-contributing resources. It was the site of an amusement park in the early Twentieth Century, but is now notable for the number and architectural variety of houses and apartment buildings constructed in the 1920s and 1930s. In 2011, the American Planning Association (APA) named Swan Lake as a Top Ten Great Neighborhood."}}
