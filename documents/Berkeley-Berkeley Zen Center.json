{"Berkeley": {"Berkeley Zen Center": "Berkeley Zen Center (BZC), temple name Shogakuji (\u6b63\u899a\u5bfa, Sh\u014dgaku-ji), is a S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist practice center located in Berkeley, California led by Sojun Mel Weitsman. An informal affiliate to the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), BZC was founded in 1967 by Weitsman and Shunryu Suzuki as a satellite group for the SFZC. Despite founding the center, Weitsman was not installed as abbot there until 1985, one year after receiving Dharma transmission from Hoitsu Suzuki. Weitsman's Dharma heir, Alan Senauke, lives on site with his wife Laurie Senauke (as of 1999) and also works for the Buddhist Peace Fellowship."}}
