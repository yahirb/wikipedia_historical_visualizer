{"New_York": {"Tribeca": "Tribeca , originally written as TriBeCa, is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Its name is a syllabic abbreviation from \"Triangle Below Canal Street\". The \"triangle\", or more accurately, a trapezoid, is bounded by Canal Street, West Street, Broadway, and either Chambers, Vesey, or Murray Streets.\nThe neighborhood began as farmland, became residential in the early 19th century, then transitioned into a mercantile one centered on produce, dry goods, and textiles, before being colonized by artists and then actors, models, entrepreneurs and other celebrities. The neighborhood is home to the Tribeca Film Festival, which was created in response to the September 11 attacks, to reinvigorate the neighborhood and downtown after the destruction caused by the terrorist attacks."}}
