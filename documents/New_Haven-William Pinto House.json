{"New_Haven": {"William Pinto House": "The William Pinto House, also known as William Pinto-Eli Whitney House, is a historic house at 275 Orange Street in New Haven, Connecticut. It is a Federal-style building of post-and-beam construction, and was built in 1810 for John Cook, a merchant. It is rare and unusual for its design, which places the gable end facing the street, rather than to the side as was more typical in the Federal period."}}
