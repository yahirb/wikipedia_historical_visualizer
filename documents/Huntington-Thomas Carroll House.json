{"Huntington": {"Thomas Carroll House": "Thomas Carroll House, also known as the Madie Carroll House, is a historic home located in the Guyandotte neighborhood in the city of Huntington, Cabell County, West Virginia. The original section of the house was built prior to 1810, and is believed to have arrived in Guyandotte by flatboat from Gallipolis, Ohio. The property was purchased by Thomas Carroll in March 1855 and remained under the ownership of his descendants until it was deeded to the Greater Huntington Parks and Recreation District on October 10, 1984 after the last tenant, Miss Madie Carroll's demise."}}
