{"Pomona": {"Harvey Mudd College": "Harvey Mudd College (HMC) is a private residential liberal arts college of science, engineering and mathematics, founded in 1955 and located in Claremont, California, United States.\nIt is one of the institutions of the contiguous Claremont Colleges (the others are Pitzer College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, Claremont Graduate University and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences), which share adjoining campus grounds. Harvey Mudd College shares university resources such as libraries, dining halls, health services and campus security with the other Claremont Colleges, although each college is independently managed, with their own faculty, board of trustees, endowment, and admissions procedures. Students at Harvey Mudd College may take classes (acceptable for academic credit at Harvey Mudd College) at the other four undergraduate Claremont colleges. The Bachelor of Science diploma received at graduation is issued by Harvey Mudd College.\nThe college is named after Harvey Seeley Mudd, one of the initial investors in the Cyprus Mines Corporation. Although involved in the planning of the new institution, Mudd died before it opened. Harvey Mudd College was funded by Mudd's friends and family, and named in his honor."}}
