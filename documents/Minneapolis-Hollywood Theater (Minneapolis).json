{"Minneapolis": {"Hollywood Theater (Minneapolis)": "The Hollywood Theater is a historic theater building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Art Deco theater building opened on October 26, 1935, and the marquee proclaimed it the \"Incomparable Showcase of the Northwest\". The theater, designed by architects Jack Liebenberg and Seeman Kaplan, had a generous budget that allowed for elaborate decoration in the Streamline Deco style of design; its facade and structure made a \"powerful statement of geometric mass punctuated by the entrance, exits, and three small windows that served the projection booth.\" Liebenberg and Kaplan went on to design the Riverview Theatre in Minneapolis and the Terrace Theatre in Robbinsdale."}}
