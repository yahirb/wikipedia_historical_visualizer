{"Homestead": {"Homestead Seaboard Air Line Railway Station": "The Homestead Seaboard Air Line Railway Station is a historic Seaboard Air Line Railroad depot in Homestead, Florida. The station is located at 214 Northwest 9th Terrace, approximately three-quarters of a mile west of downtown Homestead.\nConstructed in 1927, it is identical to the original construction of the Delray Beach Seaboard station farther north in Palm Beach County, with the sole exception of its use of the same corinthian arches used in the Naples Seaboard station and Hialeah Seaboard station, as opposed to the plain stucco arches of the Delray Beach station."}}
