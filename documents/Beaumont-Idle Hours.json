{"Beaumont": {"Idle Hours": "The house nicknamed \"Idle Hours\" was built in 1903 by architect Frank T. Smith for L.P. Ogden and his wife Cynthia. Because the house was considered to be out in the country at the time of its construction, Mrs. Ogden preferred to retain her town home and named her new country estate \"Idle Hours\"."}}
