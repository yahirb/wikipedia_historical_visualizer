{"New_York": {"African Grove": "The African Grove Theatre was a theatre founded and operated by William Alexander Brown a free black in New York City in 1821. He was from the West Indies.\nThis was six years before the final abolition of slavery in New York state (gradual abolition brought it to an end in 1827, but young people born to slave mothers had to serve apprenticeships to age 21.) The African Grove Theatre was attended by \"all types of black New Yorkers -- free and slave, middle-class and working-class\" along with others."}}
