{"Winston-Salem": {"Reynolds Gymnasium": "Reynolds Gymnasium is a multi-purpose arena located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on the campus of Wake Forest University. The arena was completed in March 1956 after the university relocated to Winston-Salem from its namesake town in Wake County.\nOriginally the home of Wake Forest women's (and on rare occasions, men's) basketball, Reynolds Gym currently plays host to the women's volleyball program, something it has done since 1971."}}
