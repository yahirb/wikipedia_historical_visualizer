It is owned and operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), whose buses mostly serve Plano-area hospitals such as the Presbyterian Hospital and the Medical Center of Plano. It is one of the few DART transit centers outside the Dallas County area.\nIn 1989 the bus station was opened as the West Plano Transit Center. On 12 October 2009, DART dignitaries and the City of Plano renamed and formally dedicated the station in memory of a respected Collin County Commissioner and transportation leader who died in 2008 after a lengthy battle with cancer."}}
