{"Fayetteville": {"Mount Sequoyah Cottages": "The Mount Sequoyah Cottages are a pair of historic summer cabins at 808 and 810 East Skyline Drive in Fayetteville, Arkansas. They are both single-story wood frame structures, faced in fieldstone and topped by a gable roof. They were built in the 1920s, around the time that the adjacent Mount Sequoyah Methodist summer camp was developed, and represent a period when the \"back to nature\" movement was a leading element in the development of summer properties."}}
