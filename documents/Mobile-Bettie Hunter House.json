{"Mobile": {"Bettie Hunter House": "The Bettie Hunter House is a historic African American residence in Mobile, Alabama, United States. It was the residence of Bettie Hunter, a former slave who grew wealthy from a successful hack and carriage business she operated in Mobile with her brother, Henry. The fall of New Orleans during the American Civil War had made Mobile the South's only major port on the Gulf of Mexico."}}
