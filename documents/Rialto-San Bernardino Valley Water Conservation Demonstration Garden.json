{"Rialto": {"San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation Demonstration Garden": "The San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation Demonstration Garden is a public teaching-research garden with just over an acre of plantings and displays that showcase water conservation through a series of themed gardens and exhibits located at California State University, San Bernardino. While located on the Cal State campus in San Bernardino, the Garden was not built with any state resources. Rather, it was made possible by major gifts from three local donors: the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (now called the West Valley Water District), the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and the Inland Empire Resource Conservation District, with additional donations from a variety of smaller donors and in-kind contributions of labor, supplies and expertise."}}
