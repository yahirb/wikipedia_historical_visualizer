{"Hemet": {"Hemet Public Library": "The Hemet Public Library is a public library in Hemet, California, United States which opened its current new library in July 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe library can trace its history back to 1906 when members of the Hemet Woman's Club wanted a place to gather and read literature, so they opened a reading room on the second floor of a bank on the Bothin Block.\nAfter the city's incorporation in 1910, citizens voted for their own library, and the new city took over the operation of its library facility."}}
