{"Santa_Clara": {"Fairmont San Jose": "The Fairmont San Jose is an AAA Four-Diamond 805-room high-rise luxury hotel at 170 South Market Street in San Jose, California, facing the water fountain in Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez.\nThere is a swimming pool and associated deck on rooftop, with a specially designed windscreen to create a microclimate designed to be acceptable for sunbathing and swimming. The analysis of this rooftop environment was carried out in the early planning stages using a computer simulation of air flow in the presence of the then existing and proposed Fairmont structures."}}
