{"Fall_River": {"Joseph Hicks House": "The Joseph Hicks House is a historic house at 494 Main Rd in Tiverton, Rhode Island. The house is a two-story wood frame structure, which was originally built with brick side walls, and became known locally as \"the Brick House\". These walls were covered over by clapboarding as part of a series of alterations in 1893, which did not otherwise significant obscure the building's modest Federal characteristics."}}
