{"Bolingbrook": {"High Road Bridge": "The High Road Bridge is a road bridge over Long Run Creek in Lockport Township, Illinois. It is the world's first road bridge built using the hybrid composite beams (also known as Hillman-Composite Beam) (HCB\u2019s) invented by John R. Hillman and developed by the HC Bridge Company LLC. The HCB\u2019s are stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than the traditional concrete or steel beams. The HCB beam with a life span of 80 to 100 years and with minimal or no maintenance to the bridge girders is a cost competitive alternative to steel and concrete beam."}}
