{"Dothan": {"Atlantic Coastline Railroad Passenger Depot": "The Atlantic Coastline Railroad Passenger Depot is a historic train station in Dothan, Alabama. By 1907, the town had outgrown its depot, and the freight depot had to be pressed into passenger service. When the new depot was completed, it was the largest and busiest on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad between Montgomery, Alabama, and Thomasville, Georgia."}}
