In 1978 it was remodeled to become a medium security (Custody Level 3) facility for adult male inmates. The original juvenile cottages formed the basis of a \"campus style\" prison with more than a dozen one or two-story buildings now stretched out across the property, fenced in by a high security double fence topped with razor wire."}}
