{"Nashville-Davidson": {"First American Cave": "The First American Cave is an archaeological and palentological site in downtown Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee. The site was initially recorded in 1971 during construction of the foundations for the First American National Bank building at 315 Deaderick Street, when workers noticed a collection of bones being unearthed within a pocket of dirt approximately 30 feet below ground surface. Excavations were halted and both the Vanderbilt University Department of Anthropology and the Southeastern Indian Antiquities Survey were notified of the find."}}
