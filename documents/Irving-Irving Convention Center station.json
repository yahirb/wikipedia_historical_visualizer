{"Irving": {"Irving Convention Center station": "Irving Convention Center station is a DART Light Rail station located in the Las Colinas development of Irving, Texas. It serves the Orange Line. The station opened in July 2012 and serves the Irving Convention Center and Las Colinas Urban Center. It briefly served as the Orange Line terminus until the North Lake College and Belt Line stations opened in December 2012.\nUpon the launch of the Orange Line, there was no direct bus connection at the station. However, DART provides a nearby bus route (503) on Las Colinas Blvd. on a weekday basis. That all changed in December 2012 when a few of the routes were diverted to this station. Parking is provided, but at an existing parking lot at North Irving Transit Center. Access to the station platform is available via a walkway and pedestrian crossing under Northwest Highway."}}
