{"Boston": {"Haymarket station (MBTA)": "Haymarket is a subway station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the MBTA's Green and Orange lines, and is located at the corner of Congress and New Sudbury streets in Downtown Boston. Haymarket allows transfers between the Orange and Green lines, as does North Station one stop to the north. Haymarket was named for Haymarket Square, which has served as a produce market since around 1830.\nUnusually, the two subway lines that converge at Haymarket are not stacked vertically underground, but instead are parallel at approximately the same level. The Orange Line access consists of two side platforms to serve the line's two tracks, while the Green Line is served by a single island platform which is divided mostly in half by a wall. Passenger transfers between lines require changing levels via stairs or elevator, so it may be preferable to transfer at more-spacious North Station, which also allows convenient cross-platform transfers for inbound trips.\nThe station is fully wheelchair accessible."}}
