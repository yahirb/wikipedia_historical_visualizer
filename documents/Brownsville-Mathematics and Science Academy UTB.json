{"Brownsville": {"Mathematics and Science Academy UTB": "The Mathematics and Science Academy (MSA), a high school located in Brownsville, Texas, was established by the 79th Texas Legislature in May 2005. It was designed as a commuter program at the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB) for high school-aged students who are gifted in mathematics and science. Rather than complete their final two years of traditional high school at other public institutions, students of the Math and Science Academy are required to take classes taught by UTB/TSC faculty with regular UTB students, but are provided with more supervision and guidance than traditional college students."}}
