{"Sandy_Springs": {"Crypt of Civilization": "The Crypt of Civilization is a sealed airtight chamber built between 1937 and 1940 at Oglethorpe University in Brookhaven, Georgia, in Metro Atlanta. The 2,000-cubic-foot (57 m3) room contains numerous artifacts and documents, and is designed for opening in the year 8113 AD. During the 50th anniversary year of its sealing, the Guinness Book of World Records cited the crypt as the \"first successful attempt to bury a record of this culture for any future inhabitants or visitors to the planet Earth.\"\n\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThornwell Jacobs (1877\u20131956), referred to as \"the father of the modern time capsule\", claims to be the first in modern times to conceive the idea of consciously preserving man-made objects for posterity by placing them in a sealed repository. Jacobs's inspiration for the project was sparked by the Egyptian pyramid and tomb openings in the 1920s."}}
