{"Lawrence": {"Joseph Perkins House": "The Joseph Perkins House is a historic house at 297 Howe Street in Methuen, Massachusetts. From its external appearance it is a Greek Revival 1.5 story wood frame house, which appears to have been built around 1840; however, it has also been assigned construction dates as early as 1752 by local historians. It clearly exhibits Greek Revival features, with corner pilasters, a deep cornice, and a center sidelighted doorway that is framed by an entablature supported by pilastered."}}
