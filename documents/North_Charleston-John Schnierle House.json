{"North_Charleston": {"John Schnierle House": "The John Schnierle House is an antebellum house in Charleston, South Carolina that was the home of Mayor John Schnierle.\nJohn Michael Schnierle, a carpenter, bought the property upon which 31 Pitt Street was built on January 9, 1817. It appears that the house was built as a rental property, as the Schnierle family continued to live at their Legare Street (then Friend Street) house until John Michael Schnierle died in 1844."}}
