{"Malden": {"Pressey-Eustis House": "The Pressey-Eustis House is a historic house at 14 Stevens Street in Winchester, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the early 1850s, and is a fine local example of Gothic Victorian decoration. It has an L-shaped layout typical of the period, with a porch at the crook of the L. Its most distinctive features are the vergeboard featuring an unusual acorn pattern, and the finials at the gable tops."}}
