El Conejo means \"The Rabbit\" in Spanish, and refers to the many rabbits common to the region (the desert cottontail and brush rabbit species). The east-west grant boundaries approximately went from the border of Westlake Village near Lindero Canyon Road in the east to the Conejo Grade (the top of the hill along the 101 Freeway looking down into Camarillo) in the west."}}
