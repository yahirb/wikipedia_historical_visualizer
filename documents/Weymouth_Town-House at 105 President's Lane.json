{"Weymouth_Town": {"House at 105 President's Lane": "The House at 105 President's Lane in Quincy, Massachusetts is the best-preserved and least-altered house of its style in the city. It is a two-story hip-roofed Colonial Revival house, with a balustrade on the roof, pedimented gable dormers, and an elliptical fanlight in the central bay window on the second floor. It was built about 1915 by Morton Swallow, about whom nothing is known."}}
