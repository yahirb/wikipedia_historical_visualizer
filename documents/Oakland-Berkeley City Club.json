{"Oakland": {"Berkeley City Club": "The Berkeley City Club was commissioned as the club house of the Berkeley Women's City Club organized in Berkeley, California in 1927 to contribute to social, civic, and cultural progress. This private club is no longer restricted to women, and the club house building is available to the public at large for overnight stays, weddings and other occasions.\nThe building, constructed in 1929, is one of the outstanding works of noted California architect Julia Morgan."}}
