{"Minneapolis": {"Minnesota Zen Center": "Minnesota Zen Meditation Center was formed when the founding head teacher, Dainin Katagiri, (1928-1990) was invited to come from California in 1972 to teach a small but growing group of Minneapolis students interested in the dharma. After his death, Shohaku Okumura served as interim head teacher until the installation of Karen Sunna, who had studied with Katagiri Roshi until his death. Succeeding Karen as head priest is Tim Burkett, a long time student of both Katagiri and Suzuki Roshi."}}
