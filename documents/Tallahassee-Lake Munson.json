{"Tallahassee": {"Lake Munson": "Lake Munson is a shallow reservoir on the southeast side of Tallahassee in Leon County, Florida.\nHistorically known as Munson's Mill Pond as early as the 1840s, in 1950 a permanent dam was constructed. From 1934 to 1984, Lake Munson received outflow from the Tallahassee waste water system, leading in 1982 to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection classifying the lake as hypereutrophic and as the seventh most degraded lake in Florida."}}
