{"Missouri_City": {"Sharpstown, Houston": "Sharpstown is a master-planned community in the Southwest Management District (formerly Greater Sharpstown), Southwest Houston, Texas It was one of the first communities to be built as a master-planned, automobile centered community and the first in Houston. Frank Sharp (1906\u20131993), the developer of the subdivision, made provisions not only for homes but also for schools, shopping and recreation areas. While this model has been duplicated countless times in the past fifty years, at the time it was quite revolutionary, attracting national media attention."}}
