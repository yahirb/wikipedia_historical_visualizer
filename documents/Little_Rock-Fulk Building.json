{"Little_Rock": {"Fulk Building": "The Fulk Building is a historic commercial building at 300 Main Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a three-story brick Romanesque Revival building, with commercial storefronts on the ground floor, and two-story round-arch bays on the upper levels. Built about 1900 for attorney and landowner Francis Fulk, it typifies buildings that lined Main Street around the turn of the 20th century, and is one of its better examples of Romanesque architecture."}}
