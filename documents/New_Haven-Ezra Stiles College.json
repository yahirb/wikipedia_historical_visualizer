{"New_Haven": {"Ezra Stiles College": "Ezra Stiles College is a residential college at Yale University, built in 1961 by Eero Saarinen. It is often simply called \"Stiles,\" despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. It was named for Ezra Stiles, seventh president of Yale."}}
