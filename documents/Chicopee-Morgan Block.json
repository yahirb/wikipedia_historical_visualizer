{"Chicopee": {"Morgan Block": "The Morgan Block is a historic commercial block at 313-333 Bridge Street (facing Stearns Park) in Springfield, Massachusetts. When the two story Classical Revival building was built in 1929, it was probably a speculative real estate venture by the Morgan Envelope Company, whose factory abutted the property in the rear. It was designed to house stores on the first floor and offices on the second, functions it continues to perform."}}
