{"Springfield": {"Edwards Place": "Edwards Place is a historic house located at 700 North 4th Street in Springfield, Illinois. The house was begun in 1833 in the Greek Revival style, making it one of the oldest houses in Springfield. (The Elijah Iles House, also in Springfield, was built in 1832.) Additions in 1836 and 1843, and a major rebuild/expansion in 1857, created the Italianate house preserved today."}}
