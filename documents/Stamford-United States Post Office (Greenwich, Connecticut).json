{"Stamford": {"United States Post Office (Greenwich, Connecticut)": "The United States Post Office of Greenwich, Connecticut is located at 310 Greenwich Avenue in the town's central business district. It was built in 1915 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nIt was included in the Greenwich Municipal Center Historic District which became NRHP-listed in 1988, and then also included in the Greenwich Avenue Historic District which subsumed that.\nIt is a uniquely planned building on a triangular site between Greenwich Avenue and Arch Street. The building appears to be one of the last of an era of post office design where government buildings were individually designed and were \"intended as monuments to bring Federal ideas and sophisticated architecture to small communities.\" Other post offices, later, were standardized.\nThe building was acquired by the company Renovation Hardware and extensively altered in 2014. The exterior post office facade remains the same. However, the interior is completely renovated to accommodate a two-story, high-value merchandise store. Moreover, Restoration Hardware expanded the rear of the building to make larger gallery space and patio space for customers."}}
