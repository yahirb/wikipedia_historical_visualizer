{"Glendora": {"Big Dalton Dam": "Big Dalton Dam is a multiple arch concrete dam in Los Angeles County, California, built for the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and completed in August 1929. The dam is one of the earliest of the multiple arch \"double-wall\" buttress designs of engineer Fred A. Noetzli. The 991 acre-foot (1.2 million cubic meter) dam provides water conservation and controls flooding from Big Dalton Canyon, a watershed within the San Dimas Experimental Forest, part of the Angeles National Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains."}}
