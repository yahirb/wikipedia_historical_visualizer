{"Kirkland": {"Redhook Ale Brewery": "The Redhook Ale Brewery, headquartered in Seattle, Washington, is a beer brewery with operations in Woodinville, Washington and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was founded in Seattle in 1981, by Paul Shipman and Gordon Bowker and is owned by Craft Brew Alliance. Although the Craft Brew Alliance has the phrase \"Craft Brew\" in its name, it does not meet the Brewers Association definition of a craft brewer, since it exceeds 25% ownership by a non-craft brewer (Anheuser-Busch InBev owns approximately 32% as of December 31, 2010)."}}
