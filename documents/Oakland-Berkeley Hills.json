{"Oakland": {"Berkeley Hills": "The Berkeley Hills are a range of the Pacific Coast Ranges that overlook the northeast side of the valley that encompasses San Francisco Bay. They were previously called the \"Contra Costa Range/Hills\" (from the original Spanish Sierra de la Contra Costa), but with the establishment of Berkeley and the University of California, the current usage was applied by geographers and gazetteers.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Berkeley Hills are bounded by the major Hayward Fault along their western base, and the minor Wildcat fault on their eastern side."}}
