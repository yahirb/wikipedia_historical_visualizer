It was created in 1911 by Puget Sound Energy and operated for hydroelectric power until it ceased power production in 2004. In December 2009 PSE sold the lake to the Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal corporation whose members are five cities (Bellevue, Issaquah, Kirkland, Redmond, and Tukwila) and two water districts (Sammamish Plateau Water and Sewer District, and the Skyway Water and Sewer District)."}}
