{"Akron": {"Canal Park (Akron, Ohio)": "Canal Park is a baseball stadium located in Akron, Ohio, United States, that is the home of the Akron RubberDucks of the Eastern League. The team is a double-A minor-league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. Opened in 1997, the stadium was designed by Populous, the same architectural firm that designed the Indians' Jacobs Field, which opened three years earlier. The stadium takes its name from its location adjacent to the Ohio and Erie Canal, which runs behind the left-field wall."}}
