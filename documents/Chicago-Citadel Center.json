{"Chicago": {"Citadel Center": "Citadel Center is a 580 ft (177m) tall skyscraper at 131 S. Dearborn St., Chicago, Illinois 60603, designed by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill. The 44th tallest building in Chicago was completed in 2003 and has 37 floors. A limited-edition cast of the Winged Victory of Samothrace, one of the world's most famous sculptures, is the showpiece of the main lobby. It was the first building in Chicago to use a raised-floor pressurized plenum system. This allowed for air to be pumped in through the floors for individuals to control their climates using floor diffusers."}}
