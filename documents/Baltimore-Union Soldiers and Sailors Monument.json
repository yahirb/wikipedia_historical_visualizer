{"Baltimore": {"Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument": "The Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument is a figural group sculpted by Adolph Alexander Weinman atop a pedestal designed by architect Albert Randolph Ross in Baltimore, United States, commemorating the Union military personnel of the American Civil War. The figural group shows Bellona and the personification of Victory together with a citizen-soldier turning from his plow and anvil as he dons a uniform and sword belt. Behind Bellona there is also a fig tree."}}
