{"Hartford": {"West Hartford Reservoir": "The West Hartford Reservoir recreation area is located on the western edge of West Hartford, Connecticut and 2.5 miles (4.0 km) northeast of Farmington, Connecticut. There are six large reservoirs along the eastern part of the park and a paved cycling trail that winds through the southern portion. The blue-blazed Metacomet Trail follows the highest ridge of the area and the network of trails throughout the area has led this to be a local mecca for mountain bikers, hikers, and trail-runners."}}
