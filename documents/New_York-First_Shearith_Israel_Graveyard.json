{"New_York": {"First Shearith Israel Graveyard": "First Shearith Israel Graveyard \u2014 also known as Chatham Square Cemetery \u2014 is a tiny Jewish graveyard at 55-57 St James Place in Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York. It is the oldest of three Manhattan graveyards currently maintained by Congregation Shearith Israel (Hebrew, \"Remnant of Israel\"), which is itself the oldest Jewish congregation in North America.  (The Congregation was formed by Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic Jewish immigrants in 1654.) Today, the cemetery is a mere fragment of its original extent. Only about a hundred headstones and above ground tombs can still be seen in what remains of the old burial ground, which rises slightly above street level. It is the only remaining 17th century structure in Manhattan."}}
