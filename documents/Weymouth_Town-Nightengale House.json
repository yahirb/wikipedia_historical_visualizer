{"Weymouth_Town": {"Nightengale House": "The Nightengale House is a historic house at 24 Quincy Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in the 1850s, probably by Thomas Nightengale, whose son Jerimiah got the property around 1876. It is a worker's cottage somewhat typical of many built during that time, with Greek Revival and Gothic Revival decorative elements."}}
