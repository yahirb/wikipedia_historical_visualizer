{"Beaverton": {"Shilo Inns": "Shilo Inns is a mid-priced hotel chain operating 31 hotels predominantly on the west coast of the United States, with a large concentration of locations in the state of Oregon. It competes primarily with mid-range, family hotels such as Comfort Inn and Best Western, and today is one of the largest independently owned and operated Hotel companies in the Western United States. Hotels are frequently two to three stories and of a gray and blue color scheme, although there are exceptions, such as their former property in Salt Lake City, which was a 13-story tan and gold hotel with red neon accents (now a Holiday Inn Express)."}}
