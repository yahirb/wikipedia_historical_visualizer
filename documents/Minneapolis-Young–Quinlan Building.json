{"Minneapolis": {"Young\u2013Quinlan Building": "The Young\u2013Quinlan Building was erected at 901 Nicollet Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1926. Elizabeth Quinlan and her partner, Fred D. Young, owned and operated a women's specialty dress shop when Young died in 1911. Miss Quinlan decided to expand her business and, wanting to have the best in design, consulted with department store managers and owners in New York and Chicago."}}
