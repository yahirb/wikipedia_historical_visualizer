{"Tacoma": {"Tacoma Mausoleum": "The Tacoma Mausoleum is a mausoleum in Tacoma, Washington, United States. Built in 1910, the mausoleum was the first such structure in the U.S. to be built west of the Mississippi River. In 1918, the mausoleum was sued by David Rea and his wife, who claimed that the existence of a mausoleum near homes constituted a nuisance."}}
