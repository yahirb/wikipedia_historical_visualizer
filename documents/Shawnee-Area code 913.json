{"Shawnee": {"Area code 913": "Area code 913 is the area code for telephone exchanges in northeastern Kansas. Prior to July 20, 1997, 913 covered all of northern Kansas from the Colorado state line to the Missouri state line. It has since been reduced to a small ribbon of eight counties bordering Missouri--an area largely coextensive with the Kansas portion of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area."}}
