{"Honolulu": {"Diamond Head, Hawaii": "Diamond Head is a volcanic tuff cone on the Hawaiian island of O\u02bbahu and known to Hawaiians as L\u0113\u02bbahi, most likely from lae 'browridge, promontory' plus \u02bbahi 'tuna' because the shape of the ridgeline resembles the shape of a tuna's dorsal fin. Its English name was given by British sailors in the 19th century, who mistook calcite crystals on the adjacent beach for diamonds.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nDiamond Head is part of the system of cones, vents, and their associated eruption flows that are collectively known to geologists as the Honolulu Volcanic Series, eruptions from the Ko\u02bbolau Volcano that took place long after the volcano formed and had gone dormant."}}
