{"Warwick": {"Alfred Drowne Road Historic District": "The Alfred Drowne Road Historic District of Barrington, Rhode Island, encompasses a suburban area developed between about 1860 and 1910, a period of significant suburban growth in Barrington spurred by the connection of the town by rail to Providence in 1855. This 27-acre (11 ha) residential area was before that time farmland owned by Alfred Drown, whose c. 1830 farmhouse still stands at 13 Alfred Drowne Road."}}
