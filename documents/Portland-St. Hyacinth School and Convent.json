{"Portland": {"St. Hyacinth School and Convent": "The St. Hyacinth School and Convent are a pair of religious and educational buildings at 2 Walker Street in Westbrook, Maine. The school, built in 1894, is a fine local example of Second Empire design, and the 1922 convent is a good example of Gothic Revival architecture."}}
