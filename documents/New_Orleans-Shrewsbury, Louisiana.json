{"New_Orleans": {"Shrewsbury, Louisiana": "Shrewsbury was an unincorporated town in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, along the Mississippi River and Shrewsbury Road about 1 mile upriver from the border of the city of New Orleans. The name came into use in the mid-19th century, and became less commonly used towards the end of the 20th century, when surrounding communities of unincorporated Jefferson grew together as a suburb of New Orleans. The area is now generally known as Old Jefferson and is part of the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area."}}
