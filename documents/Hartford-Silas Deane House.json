{"Hartford": {"Silas Deane House": "Silas Deane (January 4, 1738 [O.S. December 24, 1737] \u2013 September 23, 1789) was an American merchant, politician, and diplomat, and a supporter of American independence. Deane served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, then as the first foreign diplomat from the United States to France. Near the end of the war, Congress charged Deane with financial impropriety, and the British intercepted and published some letters in which he had implied that the American cause was hopeless."}}
