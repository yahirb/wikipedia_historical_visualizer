{"Pawtucket": {"Providence Athenaeum": "The Providence Athenaeum was founded as \"The Athenaeum\" in 1836 as an independent, member-supported library open to the public. Its progenitors were two earlier libraries: The Providence Library Company, founded in 1753, and the Providence Athenaeum, founded in 1831. It became \"The Providence Athenaeum\" by amendment to its charter in 1850."}}
