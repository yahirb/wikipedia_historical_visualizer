The project was begun around 2010 by the East Valley Jewish Community Center, following a successful Anne Frank exhibit in 2008. It will focus on history of the Holocaust with exhibits designed to expose past and present examples of prejudice, genocide and inhumanity around the globe while teaching racial and cultural tolerance."}}
