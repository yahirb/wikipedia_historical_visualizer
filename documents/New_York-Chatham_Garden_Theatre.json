{"New_York": {"Chatham Garden Theatre": "For the other theatre of this name, see Chatham Theatre.\nThe Chatham Garden Theatre or Chatham Theatre was a playhouse in the Chatham Gardens of New York City. It was located on the north side of Chatham Street on Park Row between Pearl and Duane streets in lower Manhattan. The grounds ran through to Augustus Street. The Chatham Garden Theatre was the first major competition to the high-class Park Theatre, though in its later years it sank to the bottom of New York's stratified theatrical order, below even the Bowery Theatre.\nThe Chatham Garden was converted to the Free Presbyterian Chatham Street Chapel in 1832."}}
