{"Burnsville": {"Maka Yusota": "Maka Yusota (Boiling Springs) is a sacred site revered by the Dakota people, located in Savage, Minnesota, United States. The location features a pool of water over an artesian well that remains liquid year-round. A thick layer of fine sand sits on the bottom of the pool, which traps the spring water and releases it in bursts, creating an illusion of boiling water."}}
