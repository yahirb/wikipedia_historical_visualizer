{"New_Bedford": {"Acushnet River": "The Acushnet River is the largest river, 8.6 miles (13.8 km) long, flowing into Buzzards Bay in southeastern Massachusetts, in the United States. The name \"Acushnet\" comes from the Wampanoag or Algonquian word, \"Cushnea\", meaning \"as far as the waters\", a word that was used by the original owners of the land in describing the extent of the parcel they intended to sell to the English settlers from the nearby Plimouth colony. Quite naturally, the English mistook \"Cushnea\" for a fixed placename or the name of a specific river."}}
