{"Birmingham": {"Ensley High School": "Ensley High School, located in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham, Alabama (United States), was founded in 1901 to serve the then-independent community of Ensley, which was centered on major plants operated by U.S. Steel and the American Cast Iron Pipe Company. It began with classes held at the Old Bush School before the last building, designed by architect David O. Whilldin, was constructed in 1908. In 2006, Ensley High School was merged into newly built Jackson-Olin High School."}}
