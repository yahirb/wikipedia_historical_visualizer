{"Atlanta": {"Beaver Slide": "Beaver Slide or Beavers' Slide was an African American slum area near Atlanta University documented as early as 1882. It was replaced by the University Homes public housing project in 1937, which was razed in 2008-9.\nCharles Forrest Palmer, the man who organized the clearance of Beaver Slide and creation of University Homes, stated in his autobiographical book that Beaver Slide's name was due to James Beavers, Atlanta Chief of Police from 1911\u20131915, once observing the slum from a hillside, losing his footing and sliding down into the slum, thus: \"Beavers' Slide\"."}}
