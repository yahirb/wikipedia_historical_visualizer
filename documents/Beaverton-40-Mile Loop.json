{"Beaverton": {"40-Mile Loop": "The 40-Mile Loop is a partially completed greenway trail around and through Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. It was proposed in 1903 by the Olmsted Brothers architecture firm as part of the development of Forest Park. One greenway expert calls it \"one of the most creative and resourceful greenway projects in the country.\"\nThe name's \"forty\" was obsolete within a few decades after it was proposed."}}
