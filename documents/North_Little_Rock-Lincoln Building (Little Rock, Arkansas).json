{"North_Little_Rock": {"Lincoln Building (Little Rock, Arkansas)": "The Lincoln Building is a historic commercial building at 1423-25 South Main Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick structure, built in 1905 with modest Neoclassical design elements, including bays articulated by brick pilasters with metal Corinthian capitals. It was built as a speculative real estate venture by C. J. Lincoln, a local drugstore wholesaler, and is one of the South Main Street area's best examples of the style."}}
