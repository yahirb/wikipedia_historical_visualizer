{"Monterey_Park": {"Mariachi Plaza": "Mariachi Plaza is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles, east of downtown. Since the 1930s, mariachi musicians have gathered in hopes of being hired by visitors who are looking for a full band, trio or solo singer. The plaza resembles Mexico's famed Plaza Garibaldi in both form and function and draws people from all over Los Angeles."}}
