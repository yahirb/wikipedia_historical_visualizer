{"West_Covina": {"Rancho La Puente": "Rancho La Puente was a ranch in the southern San Gabriel Valley that measured just under 49,000 acres (200 km2), and remained intact from its establishment in the late 1700s as an outpost of Mission San Gabriel until about 1870. By modern landmarks, the ranch extended from San Gabriel River on the west to just west of the 57 Freeway on the east and from Ramona Boulevard/San Bernardino Road on the north to the Puente Hills on the south. All but 40 acres (160,000 m2), which fall within Orange County, are within Los Angeles County."}}
