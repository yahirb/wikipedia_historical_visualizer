{"Baltimore": {"Edward A. Garmatz United States Courthouse": "The Edward A. Garmatz U.S. Courthouse is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\n\n== Building history ==\nDuring the 1960s, the federal courts in Baltimore occupied the old U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, now known as Courthouse East, on Calvert Street. The courts rapidly outgrew their facilities, however, and required a larger building to accommodate the growing caseload."}}
