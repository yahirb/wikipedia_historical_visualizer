{"Doral": {"Belen Jesuit Preparatory School": "Belen Jesuit Preparatory School is an all-male, Roman Catholic, preparatory school in Miami, Florida, operated by the Society of Jesus. It was established in Havana, Cuba, by the Jesuits in 1854, but moved to the United States after the communist government of Fidel Castro, himself an alumnus, took power and expelled the Jesuits. It has since made the Cardinal Newman Society's honor roll."}}
