{"Chicopee": {"Cutler and Porter Block": "The Cutler and Porter Block is a historic commercial block at 109 Lyman Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The four story brick building was constructed in 1894 for the firm of Cutler and Porter Inc, a wholesaler of shoes, boots, and rubber goods. It was made to be visually sympathetic to the adjacent Produce Exchange Building."}}
