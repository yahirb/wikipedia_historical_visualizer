{"Stamford": {"Hoyt-Barnum House": "The Hoyt-Barnum House at 1508 High Ridge Road in Stamford, Connecticut, was built around 1699, and is the oldest house in Stamford. The builder was a descendant of one of the original founders of Stamford. The large chimney stack of the Hoyt-Barnum House is made of field stone, laid up with clay, animal hair, and straw. The house is braced timber frame construction or post and beam. The foundation is of field stone. The west room of the house is plastered. The east room is whitewashed and the hearth room walls are sheathed with wood paneling, thus showing the various finishing techniques incorporated into the house during its evolution.\nThe house is now owned and maintained as a museum by the Stamford Historical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In 2017, it was moved from its original location at 713 Bedford Street to its new location next to the Stamford Historical Society where it is open for tours."}}
