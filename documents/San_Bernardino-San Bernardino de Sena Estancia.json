{"San_Bernardino": {"San Bernardino de Sena Estancia": "The San Bernardino de Sena Estancia (also known as the San Bernardino Rancho or Asistencia) was a ranch outpost of Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel in what is now in Redlands, California, United States. It was built to graze cattle, and for Indian Reductions of the Serrano people and Cahuilla people into Mission Indians. Over time, it fell into disrepair, until the early 20th century, when a new, larger structure was built as a museum."}}
