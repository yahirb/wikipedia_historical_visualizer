{"Boston": {"Granary Burying Ground": "The Granary Burying Ground in Massachusetts is the city of Boston's third-oldest cemetery, founded in 1660 and located on Tremont Street. It is the final resting place for many notable Revolutionary War-era patriots, including Paul Revere, the five victims of the Boston Massacre, and three signers of the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine. The cemetery has 2,345 grave-markers, but historians estimate that as many as 5,000 people are buried in it. The cemetery is adjacent to Park Street Church and immediately across from Suffolk University Law School.\nThe cemetery's Egyptian revival gate and fence were designed by architect Isaiah Rogers (1800\u20131869), who designed an identical gate for Newport's Touro Cemetery."}}
