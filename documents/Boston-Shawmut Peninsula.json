{"Boston": {"Shawmut Peninsula": "Shawmut Peninsula is the promontory of land on which Boston, Massachusetts was built. The peninsula, originally a mere 789 acres (3.19 km2) in area, more than doubled in size due to land reclamation efforts that were a feature of the history of Boston throughout the 19th century."}}
