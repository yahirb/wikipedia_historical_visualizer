{"New_Orleans": {"U.S. Army Supply Base New Orleans": "The US Army Supply Base in New Orleans is a former military supply depot that was established in 1919. It served the United States military installations in the Gulf Coast of the United States through two world wars, and up through 2005 when it was closed and sold to the city of New Orleans.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nRobert F. Broussard, United States Senator from Louisiana, urged Quartermaster General of the United States Army Henry Granville Sharpe to consider New Orleans as a location for a new supply depot to equip Gulf Coast military regiments that had formed in response to the 1917 outbreak of World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, making it one of thirteen Army supply depots in the United States as of that date."}}
