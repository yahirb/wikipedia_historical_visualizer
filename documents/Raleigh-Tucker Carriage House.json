{"Raleigh": {"Tucker Carriage House": "The Tucker Carriage House is a historic carriage house located at Raleigh, North Carolina. It is a large, three-story outbuilding that is the only remaining structure from the estate of Rufus Sylvester Tucker, a Confederate army officer and prominent merchant in post-Civil War Raleigh. It is believed to have been built around 1883, when Tucker purchased materials for a \"wagon shed\", but does not appear on maps of the area until 1909."}}
