{"Bismarck": {"North Dakota's 2nd congressional district": "North Dakota's 2nd congressional district is an obsolete congressional district in the state of North Dakota that was created by reapportionments in 1913, and eliminated by the reapportionments in 1933. North Dakota elected its two Representatives in a two-member at large district from 1932 to 1960, but then resurrected single-member districts in 1962. The district was eliminated by the reapportionment as a result of the 1970 census."}}
