{"Oakland": {"Moffitt Library": "Moffitt Library, designed by John Carl Warnecke in the late 1960s as a cutting-edge library for undergraduates, sits at the crossroads of the University of California, Berkeley. Named after James K. Moffitt, a regent of the University of California, the library has been a popular destination for students for over four decades. Campus and curriculum changes in the time since Moffitt Library opened have been a catalyst for considering new purposes for this highly trafficked space."}}
