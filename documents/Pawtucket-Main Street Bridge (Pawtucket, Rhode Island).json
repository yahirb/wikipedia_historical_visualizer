{"Pawtucket": {"Main Street Bridge (Pawtucket, Rhode Island)": "The Main Street Bridge is an historic bridge carrying Main Street over the Pawtucket Falls in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The oldest portion of this bridge consists of two flattened-arch spans, each about 40 feet (12 m) in length, with a total bridge length of 110 feet (34 m). The bridge has been widened twice to accommodate increased traffic; the most recent widening was in the 1960s, when concrete abutments were added to the south, and the added section completed with I-beams."}}
