It includes all triple deckers on those two streets between Vernon Street and Perry Avenue, and exclude other forms of housing in the area. Of the 40 triple deckers in the district, 27 have gambrel roofs, and most of these have an asymmetrical facade with porches on the first two levels, and a recessed porch area in the gambrel section of the facade."}}
