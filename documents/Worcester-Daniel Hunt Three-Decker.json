{"Worcester": {"Daniel Hunt Three-Decker": "The Daniel Hunt Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 9 Wyman Street in the Main South neighborhood of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is well preserved representative of the housing boom that took place in the area in the 1880s and 1890s, with significant early Queen Anne styling. It was built in 1890, and its first owner was Daniel Hunt, a machinist who lived next door."}}
