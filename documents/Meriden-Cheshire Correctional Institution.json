{"Meriden": {"Cheshire Correctional Institution": "Cheshire Correctional Institution is a Connecticut Department of Correction state prison for men located in Cheshire, New Haven County, Connecticut. The facility was built beginning in 1910, partly by the inmates of the Wethersfield State Prison, and opened in 1913 as the Chester Reformatory for male youths ages 16 to 24. In 1982, the state's Manson Youth Institution opened adjacent to the CCI, and Cheshire was re-designated as an adult prison."}}
