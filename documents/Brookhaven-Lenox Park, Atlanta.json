{"Brookhaven": {"Lenox Park, Atlanta": "Lenox Park in the City of Atlanta was a subdivision begun in 1931 under the supervision of Ivey and Crook, architects. Today it forms part of the larger neighborhood of Morningside-Lenox Park. The iconic Lenox Park urn-and-column markers (several are still standing) were the inspiration for the more numerous Morningside-Lenox Park columns standing at the entrance to the larger neighborhood."}}
