{"Taunton": {"Thomas Nichols Three Deckers": "The Thomas Nichols Three Deckers are three historic triple-decker houses located at 68, 80 and 88 West Britannia Street in Taunton, Massachusetts. The once-identical buildings were built in 1914 by Thomas Nichols, a real estate speculator. Two of the three (numbers 68 and 80) were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for their external architecture and rarity of form in the city; #68 has since been compromised by alterations."}}
