{"Newark": {"Brick Towers": "Brick Towers was a 324-unit affordable housing development in Newark, New Jersey, originally occupied in 1970. The buildings were demolished in 2008, despite opposition by the City\u2019s Mayor Cory Booker, who was living in the property at the time. Although the buildings were reported structurally sound, there were persistent problems with poor management and associated criminal activity."}}
