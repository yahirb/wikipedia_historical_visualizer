{"Akron": {"Rubber Bowl": "The Rubber Bowl is a stadium located in Akron, Ohio, primarily used for American football. From its opening in 1940 until 2008, it served as the home field of the Akron Zips football team of the University of Akron prior to the opening of InfoCision Stadium \u2013 Summa Field. Throughout its history, it has also hosted concerts, professional football, high school football, and other events. It is named after the predominance of the tire industry in Akron. The stadium has a seating capacity of 35,202 and is located in southeastern Akron next to Akron Fulton International Airport and Derby Downs, about 6 miles (9.7 km) southeast of downtown.\nSince 2008, the stadium has been mostly vacant, hosting some high school football games. In 2013, the Rubber Bowl was acquired by Canton, Ohio-based Team1 Marketing Group Inc. with plans to renovate and update the structure as the home for a professional football team. Renovation work began later in 2013, but initial plans for a professional team in the revived United States Football League (USFL) fell through."}}
