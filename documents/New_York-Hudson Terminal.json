{"New_York": {"Hudson Terminal": "Hudson Terminal was an urban railway station on the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Located in a neighborhood called Radio Row, it also featured two 22-story office skyscrapers built to serve the terminal. The facility operated from 1909 to 1971, and was mostly demolished by 1972. It was replaced by the original World Trade Center and its PATH station, a business complex of seven buildings dedicated to international trade."}}
