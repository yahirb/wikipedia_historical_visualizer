{"Medford": {"W.W. Kimball House": "The W.W. Kimball House is a historic house at 13 Winter Street in Arlington, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built sometime between 1847 and 1865, and is one of two houses (the other is the House at 5-7 Winter Street) built by John Squire. Squire probably never lived in the house, but sold it in 1865 to William and Nancy Kimball, who apparently rented it out."}}
