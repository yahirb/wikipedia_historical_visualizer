{"Wilmington": {"Brandywine Village": "Brandywine Village was an early center of U.S. industrialization located on the Brandywine River in what is now Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe Brandywine crosses the Fall Line just north of Wilmington, and descends from about 160 feet (49 m) above sea level in Chadds Ford to just a few feet above sea level in Wilmington. The river's descent allowed manufacturers \u2014 notably, of flour and gunpowder \u2014 to use high-powered machinery in the days before the steam engine, while its navigable channel to the Delaware River and Delaware Bay allowed them to load oceangoing ships."}}
