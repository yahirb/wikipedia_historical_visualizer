{"Lincoln": {"1894 Rock Island railroad wreck": "The 1894 Rock Island railroad wreck occurred when a locomotive carrying two passenger cars was sabotaged on August 9, 1894, in Lincoln, Nebraska. The train was purposely derailed from a 40-foot trestle which today passes above the Jamaica North Trail at Wilderness Park in Lincoln, Nebraska, killing 11. To date, the sabotage is one of the largest instances of mass murder in the state of Nebraska, along with the 1958 killing spree of Charles Starkweather, and the Westroads Mall shooting of 2007. It is also the largest officially unsolved crime in Lincoln history."}}
