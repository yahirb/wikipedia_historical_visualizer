{"Alameda": {"Joaquin Miller House": "The Joaquin Miller House, also known as The Abbey and The Hights [sic], is a historic house in Joaquin Miller Park, a public park in the Oakland Hills area of Oakland, California, United States. A crude, vaguely Gothic structure, it was the home of poet Joaquin Miller from 1886 until his death in 1913. Miller was one of the nation's first poets to write about the far western United States."}}
