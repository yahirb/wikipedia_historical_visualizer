{"Nashville-Davidson": {"Castner-Knott Building": "Castner Knott Company was a Nashville, Tennessee-based regional department store chain which operated stores in Kentucky and Alabama, along with Tennessee. The chain was in business for a century from 1898 to 1998, in its later years as a division of Mercantile Stores Company.\nCastner Knott's historic flagship location on Nashville's Church Street closed in 1996, while the remaining stores were among those sold to Little Rock, Arkansas-based Dillard's, when it acquired Mercantile in 1998."}}
