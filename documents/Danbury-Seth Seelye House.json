{"Danbury": {"Seth Seelye House": "The Seth Seelye House, now the Bethel Public Library, is a historic building at 189 Greenwood Street in Bethel, Connecticut. Built in 1842, the house is gable-fronted, with four relatively slender Doric style columns in a portico supporting the gable-front pediment above. A modern two-story wing extends the building to the rear."}}
