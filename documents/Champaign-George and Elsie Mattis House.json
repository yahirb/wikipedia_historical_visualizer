{"Champaign": {"George and Elsie Mattis House": "The George and Elsie Mattis House is a historic house located at 900 West Park Avenue in Champaign. The house was built in 1926; while it was constructed around the frame of a Queen Anne house from 1893, its redesign was so extensive that the 1926 house is effectively a new building. Locally prominent architect George Ramey designed the house in the Georgian Revival style; the English Brothers, a firm known for its commercial and public works throughout the state, built the house."}}
