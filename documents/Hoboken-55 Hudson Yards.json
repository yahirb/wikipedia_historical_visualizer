{"Hoboken": {"55 Hudson Yards": "55 Hudson Yards (also known as One Hudson Yards or One Hudson Boulevard) is a future tower just outside the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. Located in Chelsea, Manhattan, it will add a combined four million square feet (370,000 m2) of space to the Hudson Yards project, along with 50 Hudson Yards, even though the two buildings will be located outside the redevelopment site itself.\nFormerly, the area was planned to be the site of the now-canceled World Product Center, at the same site as 55 Hudson Yards."}}
