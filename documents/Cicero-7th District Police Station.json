{"Cicero": {"7th District Police Station": "The 7th District Police Station, or Maxwell Street Station in Chicago, Illinois, was built in 1888 in response to the need for increased police presence in \"Bloody Maxwell\", known colloquially as \"the Wickedest Police District in the World.\" The neighborhood, a changing melting pot of Irish, German, Italian and European Jewish immigrants, grew mightily in the years following the Chicago Fire of 1871. The housing and sanitation situation in the district was substandard, and the residents poor. Criminal activity flourished."}}
