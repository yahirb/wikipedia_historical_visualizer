{"Jonesboro": {"Nash-Reid-Hill House": "The Nash-Reid-Hill House is a historic house at 418 West Matthews Avenue in Jonesboro, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame house, faced in brick veneer, with a hipped roof that has multiple cross gables and a three-story tower with a conical roof. The house was built between 1898 and 1902, using locally fired brick, and is a locally notable example of Queen Anne architecture, although its porch was modified in 1934 to give it a more French Eclectic appearance."}}
