{"Cleveland": {"Defunct townships of Cuyahoga County, Ohio": "Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States is divided into twenty-one townships.\nWhen Cuyahoga County was founded, it was divided into civil townships for purposes of rural government, as were other Ohio counties. By 1990, this county was the most urbanized county in Ohio, and as a result, most of its townships have been annexed by the city of Cleveland or one of the other municipalities in Cuyahoga County."}}
