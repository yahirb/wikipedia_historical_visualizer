{"Daly_City": {"Brisbane Baylands development": "The Brisbane Baylands is a 660-acre (270 ha) parcel of land in Brisbane, near the border with San Francisco. There have been several proposals to develop the site, which was previously used as a railyard and a municipal landfill; historical uses have led to contaminated soil, polluted stormwater runoff, and potential buried toxic waste. None of the present proposals have been approved by Brisbane's city council."}}
