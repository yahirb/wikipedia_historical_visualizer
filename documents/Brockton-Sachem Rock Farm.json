{"Brockton": {"Sachem Rock Farm": "Sachem Rock Farm is a historic farm at 355 Plymouth Street in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The farm location is important for a variety of reasons. Its earliest historical association is with the Wampanoag people, who are known to have used the area, particularly around Sachem Rock, a granite oucrop that is the property's high point, prior to European contact."}}
