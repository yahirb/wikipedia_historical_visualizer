{"Atlanta": {"St. Mark United Methodist Church (Atlanta)": "Saint Mark Methodist Church is one of the few remaining Gothic Revival granite churches in Atlanta, Georgia. The current building was constructed from 1902 to 1903 after the congregation of Merritts Avenue Methodist Church outgrew their old building. The architecture is notable for its use of Stone Mountain granite, triple entrance portal, and pot-metal stained-glass windows."}}
