{"Pomona": {"Ygnacio Palomares Adobe": "The Ygnacio Palomares Adobe, also known as Adobe de Palomares, is a one-story adobe in Pomona, California, built between 1850 and 1855 as a residence for Don Ygnacio Palomares. The adobe was abandoned in the 1880s and was left to the elements until it was acquired by the City of Pomona in the 1930s. In 1939, the adobe was restored in a joint project of the City of Pomona, the Historical Society of Pomona Valley and the Works Project Administration. Since 1940, the adobe has been open to the public as a museum on life in the Spanish and Mexican ranchos. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Of the more than 400 sites in Los Angeles County that have been listed on the National Register, fewer than ten received the distinction prior to the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe."}}
