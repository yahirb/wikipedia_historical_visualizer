{"Camden": {"Washington Grays Monument": "Washington Grays Monument (also known as the \"Pennsylvania Volunteer\") is a bronze statue by John A. Wilson. The monument represents the Washington Grays who served in the 17th, 21st and 49th Pennsylvania Militia during the American Civil War. In 1925, almost 20 years after the sculpture was made, renowned sculptor and art historian Lorado Taft wrote, \"No American sculpture has surpassed the compelling power which John A. Wilson put into his steady, motionless 'Pennsylvania Volunteer'.\" Joseph Wilson built the base of the monument which was unveiled on April 19, 1872."}}
