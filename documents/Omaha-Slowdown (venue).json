{"Omaha": {"Slowdown (venue)": "Slowdown is an entertainment venue located at 729 North 14 Street in NoDo, a new development near the Near North Side neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska. A combination of a live music venue, shops, restaurants and apartments, the venue was developed by Saddle Creek Records as a direct competitor to the Sokol Auditorium in Little Bohemia. Slowdown is said to be \"unlike anything in Omaha - or the Midwest\" because of its comprehensive, mixed-use design."}}
