{"Highland": {"Highland Historic District (Highland, California)": "The Highland Historic District is a historic district encompassing some of the oldest parts of Highland, California. The district includes the city's original townsite, which was platted in 1891, and parts of a 1904 addition; significant development in the district continued through 1938. Development in Highland was driven by the citrus industry, Southern California's dominant industry at the time; as Highland was located at the junction of the busy Palm Avenue and the newly completed Santa Fe Railroad, it became a natural industrial center."}}
