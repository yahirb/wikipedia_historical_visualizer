{"Duluth": {"Bayview Heights (Duluth)": "Bayview Heights is a primarily residential neighborhood in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. Although it is grouped by the city with the West Duluth communities, it often functions more as a part of the city of Proctor than of Duluth, due primarily to its hilltop location (1200 feet or roughly 400 m above sea level) rather than the 600 feet or roughly 200 m above sea level typical of West Duluth neighborhoods.\nThe neighborhood is centered on Duluth's Vinland Street, where the elementary school, affiliated with Proctor's school district, is located."}}
