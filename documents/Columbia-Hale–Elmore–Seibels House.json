{"Columbia": {"Hale\u2013Elmore\u2013Seibels House": "The Hale\u2013Elmore\u2013Seibels House or Seibels House is a historic building located in Columbia, South Carolina. Records of the exact year of its construction were destroyed in 1865 during the burning of the city by Union soldiers serving under General William Tecumseh Sherman. The best guess for the date of construction stems from a purported \"1796\" carved into a beam in the basement."}}
