{"Dearborn": {"Temple Baptist Church \u2013 King Solomon Baptist Church": "Temple Baptist Church/King Solomon Baptist Church consists of two buildings at the intersection of Fourteenth Avenue and Marquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. The original church, which later became known as the Educational and Recreation Building, is a Tudor Revival structure built by architect J. Will Wilson in 1917, then remodeled and made into classrooms and office space by 1940. The second building, also known as the Main Auditorium, is an Art Deco building constructed in 1937 and remains largely unchanged."}}
