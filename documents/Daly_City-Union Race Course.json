{"Daly_City": {"Union Race Course": "Union Race Course was a horse racing track opened in the 1850s in San Francisco, California located in the Mission District. There were two horse race courses in the Mission District at this time, the other being Pioneer Race Course which was located a few blocks away. At the time it was planned to be built, no streets existed in this neighborhood but later it appears to be bound by 19th St to 23rd St and Capp St to Harrison St."}}
