{"Bellevue": {"Drinkmore Cafe": "The Drinkmore Cafe is a coffee shop on Capitol Hill in Seattle, Washington. Opened on April 1, 2000 as the Bit Star, it was reported by InfoWorld to be the first commercial business to offer free wireless internet wifi services. Although few had the equipment necessary to take advantage of this, free wireless internet became a major component of the small coffee shop business model across America."}}
