{"Alameda": {"MacArthur Maze": "The MacArthur Maze (or simply the Maze, also called the Distribution Structure) is a large freeway interchange near the east end of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge in Oakland, California. It splits Bay Bridge traffic into three freeways\u2014the Eastshore (I-80/I-580), MacArthur (I-580) and Nimitz (I-880).\n\n\n== Description ==\nSan Francisco Bay Area traffic funnels across the few bridges spanning the bay, so the Maze's central location near the east end of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge makes it a hub for east\u2013west and north\u2013south traffic accessing San Francisco."}}
