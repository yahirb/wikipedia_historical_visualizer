In 1818 it was purchased for the sum of $20,000 by Richard Caton, the husband of Mary, youngest daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. For the last twelve years of his life, Charles Carroll spent his winters in the house, often receiving distinguished visitors there."}}
