{"Malden": {"William M. Davis House": "The William Morris Davis House is a National Historic Landmark on 17 Francis Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An architecturally undistinguished Queen Anne-era house, probably built in the 1890s, it is notable as the home of William Morris Davis between 1898 and 1916. Davis (1850-1934) was a professor of geology at Harvard University, and an influential figure in the development of meteorology and geomorphology as scientific disciplines."}}
