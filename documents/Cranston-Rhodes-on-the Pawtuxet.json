{"Cranston": {"Rhodes-on-the Pawtuxet": "Rhodes-on-the Pawtuxet is a historic recreational complex at Rhodes Place, on the Pawtuxet River in Cranston, Rhode Island. Originally consisting of a series of buildings, including a stateroom, pavilion, and waterfront facilities, today only a ballroom and gazebo survive. The ballroom is a Classical Revival building designed by architects John F. O'Malley and Harry A. Lewis and built in 1915, after the entire complex, except for the stateroom and gazebo, was destroyed by fire."}}
