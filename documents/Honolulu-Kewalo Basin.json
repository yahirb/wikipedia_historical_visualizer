{"Honolulu": {"Kewalo Basin": "Kewalo Basin is a commercial boat harbor that serves as home to some of Honolulu's commercial fishing fleet, and charter and excursion vessels that serve the Hawaii tourist market. Pre-European contact, the area was historically used for human sacrifice. The land was given to Ihu by Kamehameha I and inherited by his daughter Kamake\u02bbe and her husband Jonah Piikoi."}}
