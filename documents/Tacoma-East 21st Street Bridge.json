{"Tacoma": {"East 21st Street Bridge": "The East 21st Street Bridge is a 682-foot (208 m) or 707-foot (215 m) or 992-foot (302 m) long cable-stayed bridge in Tacoma, Washington completed in January, 1997. The bridge, whose most significant feature is two 180-foot (55 m) tall towers, carries four lanes State Route 509 (SR 509) across the Thea Foss Waterway from downtown Tacoma to the Port of Tacoma. SR 509 ends at a single point urban interchange with Interstate 705 west of the bridge, built as part of the same $165.3 million WSDOT project that also funded the bridge's construction."}}
