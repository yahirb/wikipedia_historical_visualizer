{"Waltham": {"Waltham High School (historic)": "The old Waltham High School (located at 55 School Street) was constructed in 1902. Designed by Samuel Patch and Robert Glancey, it follows the local contemporary style of Romanesque and Classical Revival architecture. Expanded in the 1920s, the building eventually fell out of favor and was replaced with the current Waltham High School at a different location in 1969."}}
