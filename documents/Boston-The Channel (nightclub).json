{"Boston": {"The Channel (nightclub)": "The Channel was a music venue located in Boston, Massachusetts that was part of the underground arts community of South Boston.\n\n\n== History ==\nJoe Cicerone, Harry Booras and Rich Clements founded The Channel in 1980, choosing the name because the club sat at the edge of the Fort Point Channel, which separates South Boston from the Financial District. The club was on the other side and a little south of where the Boston Tea Party took place (old Griffin's Wharf) in 1773."}}
