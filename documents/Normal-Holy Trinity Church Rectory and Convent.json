{"Normal": {"Holy Trinity Church Rectory and Convent": "The Holy Trinity Church Rectory and Convent in Bloomington, Illinois, USA, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. The Rectory and Convent Building is situated behind the art deco church on the site of the 1869 Holy Trinity Church, which was destroyed by a tornado before it was completed. A fire completely obliterated the church in 1932, but the church was financed, and recovery was quick."}}
