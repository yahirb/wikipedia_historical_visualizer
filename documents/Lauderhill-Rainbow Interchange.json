{"Lauderhill": {"Rainbow Interchange": "The Rainbow Interchange is one of three named interchanges in southeastern Florida (the others being Miami's Golden Glades Interchange and Miami's Midtown Interchange). It is a four-level stack interchange near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The local media dubbed the interchange between Interstate 95 (State Road 9) and Interstate 595 (SR 862) Rainbow because each overpass and flyover bridge is painted in a different color."}}
