{"Santa_Clarita": {"San Francisquito Creek (Santa Clara River tributary)": "The Santa Clara River is 83 miles (134 km) long, and is one of the most dynamic river systems in southern California. The river drains parts of four ranges in the Transverse Ranges System north and northwest of Los Angeles, then flows west onto the Oxnard Plain and into the Santa Barbara Channel of the Pacific Ocean.\nThe watershed has provided habitat for a wide array of native plants and animals and has historically supplied humans with water, fish, and fertile farmland."}}
