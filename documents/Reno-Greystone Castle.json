{"Reno": {"Greystone Castle": "Greystone Castle is a small Tudor style cottage in the Newlands Manor section of Reno, Nevada. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of its architectural style as well as its ties into Reno's history as a migratory divorce town. Starting with the William E. Corey divorce, Reno became known for its much quicker and simpler divorce laws, the only catch was that the individuals had to stay in town for six months to achieve residency."}}
