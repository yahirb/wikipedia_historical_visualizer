{"Bellevue": {"Nora's Woods": "Nora's Woods is an undeveloped city park and native plant garden in the Madrona neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The 0.35-acre (0.14 ha) house lot-sized wooded area is named for Seattleite Nora Woods, who purchased the land in 1987 that was given to The Trust for Public Land after her death in 1989. Cleanup of the overgrown and neglected property by neighborhood volunteers to create the park began in 1996 or 1997."}}
