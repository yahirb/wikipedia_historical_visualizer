{"Conway": {"Hendrix College Addition Neighborhood Historic District": "The Hendrix College Addition Neighborhood Historic District encompasses a predominantly residential area of Conway, Arkansas that was developed in the first half of the 20th century. Located just north of the Hendrix College campus, it is an area of about 40 acres (16 ha) and twelve square blocks, bounded on the south by Winfield Street, the west by Washington Avenue, the east by Harkrider Street, and the north by Fleming Street. Architecturally, the houses in the neighborhood represent a cross-section of styles popular in the period, from the Prairie School and English Revival, to post-World War II ranch houses."}}
