{"Buffalo": {"The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse": "The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&P, was an American chain of grocery stores that ceased supermarket operations in November 2015, after 156 years in business. From 1915 through 1975, A&P was the largest grocery retailer in the United States (and until 1965, the largest U.S. retailer of any kind). A&P was considered an American icon that according to The Wall Street Journal \"was as well known as McDonald's or Google is today\" and that A&P was \"Walmart before Walmart.\" Known for innovation, A&P and the supermarkets that followed its lead significantly improved nutritional habits by making available a vast assortment of food products at much lower costs."}}
