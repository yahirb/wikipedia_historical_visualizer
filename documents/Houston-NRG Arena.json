{"Houston": {"NRG Arena": "The NRG Arena (formerly the Astroarena and Reliant Arena), is a 350,000 square feet (33,000 m\u00b2) sports center in NRG Park, in Houston, Texas, USA. It is one of the state's major arenas and convention centers.\n\n\n== Building format ==\nThe main partition on the first floor is the \"Arena Proper\", a 24,000 gross square foot arena that seats up to 8,500 people. While dwarfed by the stadiums within the complex (the NRG Astrodome seats 60,000 and NRG Stadium seats 70,000) as well as other arenas in the city (the Toyota Center seats 18,500, TDECU Stadium seats 40,000, and Minute Maid Park seats 42,000), it serves as a location for events that cannot fill such large arenas."}}
