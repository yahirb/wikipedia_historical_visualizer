{"Yorba_Linda": {"Peralta Hills": "The Peralta Hills are a ridge of hills in northeastern Orange County, California.\nThe ridge technically begins with Burruel Point (685 feet) in the city of Orange, close to where Nohl Ranch Road meets the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), although there are hills to the west of Burruel Point, extending into the vast alluvial plain of the Los Angeles Basin to the community of Olive, California, ending roughly at the intersection of Orange-Olive Road and Lincoln Avenue.\nThe ridge gains in elevation eastward, with peaks of 500 to 1,000 feet, until it meets the Santa Ana Mountains along the eastern boundaries of the city of Anaheim, roughly at the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 241)."}}
