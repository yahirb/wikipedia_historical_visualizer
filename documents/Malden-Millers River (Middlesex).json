{"Malden": {"Millers River (Middlesex)": "Millers River (frequently written as Miller's River) was a river in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. It has since mostly been obscured by landfill and \"made land\" (land created by filling of waterways). The small remaining estuary is a remnant of wetlands and open water that once divided Cambridge from Charlestown, Massachusetts."}}
