{"Cicero": {"Robert Lindblom Math & Science Academy": "Robert Lindblom Math & Science Academy High School (LMSA) (simply known as Lindblom) is a public 4-year selective enrollment high school located in the West Englewood neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, operated by the Chicago Public School system. The school, originally constructed in 1919 and named Lindblom Technical High School, is named for Robert Lindblom, a nineteenth-century Swedish\u2013born trader on the Chicago Board of Trade. Designated for students intended to enter vocations in industrial and skilled trades, in the later 20th century, it developed curricula to prepare students for college and was known as Lindblom College Prep High School."}}
