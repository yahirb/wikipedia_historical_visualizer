{"Madison": {"Hartmeyer Ice Arena": "Hartmeyer Ice Arena is a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in Madison, Wisconsin. It has ice surfaces for hockey, figure skating and open skating, but can also have the ice removed for other events, such as indoor football.\nThe building was constructed to play host to the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team, but only served that purpose for four years before the team moved to the Dane County Coliseum, now known as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the campus of the Alliant Energy Center."}}
