{"Fall_River": {"Stone Bridge (Rhode Island)": "The Stone Bridge was a bridge built in 1907 in Rhode Island that carried RI 138 over the Sakonnet River between Portsmouth and Tiverton. It was severely damaged by Hurricane Carol in 1954, and replaced in 1956 by the Sakonnet River Bridge, which was under construction at the time of the hurricane, located 0.8 mi (1.3 km) to the north. The span was closed to marine traffic after the hurricane."}}
