{"Ogden": {"Fort Buenaventura": "Fort Buenaventura, located in west Ogden, Utah, United States, was the first permanent Anglo settlement in the Great Basin. It was founded in 1846 just east of the Weber River, west of current downtown Ogden, Utah. The fort and the surrounding land were bought by the Mormon settlers in 1847 and renamed Brownsville (then later Ogden)."}}
