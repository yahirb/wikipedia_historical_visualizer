{"Portland": {"The Gothic House": "The Gothic House, also known as the John J. Brown House, is an historic house at 387 Spring Street in Portland, Maine. Built in 1845, it is one of Maine's finest and earliest known examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Although it is virtually unaltered, it was moved down Spring Street in 1971 to avoid demolition."}}
