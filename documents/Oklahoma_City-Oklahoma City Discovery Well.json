{"Oklahoma_City": {"Oklahoma City Discovery Well": "The Oklahoma City Discovery Well was the first successful oil well to be drilled in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The December 4, 1928 discovery opened the Oklahoma City Oil Field to extensive exploitation, creating an oil boom that sustained the area through the Great Depression. Because much of the oil was under the existing city, the Oklahoma City field pioneered the use of directional drilling to allow lateral displacement of well bores to reach deposits under developed areas."}}
