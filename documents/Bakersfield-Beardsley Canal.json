{"Bakersfield": {"Beardsley Canal": "Beardsley Canal is an irrigation canal in Kern County, California. It originates for the Kern River, east of Gordon's Ferry and just west of the First Point of Measurement. It is the first diversion from the river in the San Joaquin Valley for agriculture irrigation (Hart Park has two canals, but are used exclusively for aesthetics and reconnect to the river)."}}
