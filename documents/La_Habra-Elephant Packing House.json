{"La_Habra": {"Elephant Packing House": "The Elephant Packing House was built in 1924, in Fullerton, Orange County, Southern California. Valencia oranges were packed here, from the abundant orchards that then dominated the county and gave it its name. William Wolfskill had developed and extensively planted the Valencia orange here in the 19th century."}}
