{"Macon": {"Fort Benjamin Hawkins": "Fort Hawkins was a fort built in 1806\u20131810 in the historic Creek Nation by the United States government under President Thomas Jefferson and used until 1824. Built in what is now Georgia at the Fall Line on the east side of the Ocmulgee River, the fort overlooked the sacred ancient earthwork mounds of the Ocmulgee Old Fields, now known as the Ocmulgee National Monument, and the Lower Creek Pathway. A trading settlement and later the city of Macon, Georgia, developed in the area prior to the construction of the fort, with Scottish fur traders being in the area as early as the 1650s."}}
