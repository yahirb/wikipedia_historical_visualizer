{"Fall_River": {"J. V. Johnson House": "The J. V. Johnson House is a historic house at 36 Riverview Avenue in Swansea, Massachusetts. This 1-1/2 Craftsman bungalow is locally distinctive for its use of stone as a building material and tile as a roofing material. It has the wide eaves and low-slung dormers characteristic of that style, as well as decorative terra cotta wall panels."}}
