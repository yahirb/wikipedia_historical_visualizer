{"Clifton": {"Capitol Theatre (Passaic, New Jersey)": "The Capitol Theatre was an entertainment venue located at the intersection of Monroe Street and Central Avenue in Passaic, New Jersey. Built in 1926 as a vaudeville house, the Capitol later served as a movie theater (in its later years a XXX movie theatre) and (after John Scher bought the property) a venue for rock concerts.\nThroughout the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, the 3,200-seat theatre was a popular stop on nearly every major rock artist's tour."}}
