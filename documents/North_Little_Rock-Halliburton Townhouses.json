{"North_Little_Rock": {"Halliburton Townhouses": "The Halliburton Townhouses are a pair of virtually identical residential buildings at 1601 and 1605 Center Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. They are two story wood frame Classical Revival structures, dominated by oversides two-story gabled porticos supported by Corinthian columns. They were built in 1905 or 1906 in what was then one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of the city."}}
