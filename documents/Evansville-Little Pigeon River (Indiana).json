{"Evansville": {"Little Pigeon River (Indiana)": "Little Pigeon River or Little Pigeon Creek is a stream located in northwestern Spencer County and northeastern Warrick County, Indiana. The 1,000 acre watershed feeds marshland which, when the stream is high, provides a good habitat for ducks. It was the site of the Little Pigeon Creek Community, Abraham Lincoln's Indiana boyhood home, now the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial."}}
