{"Chattanooga": {"Red Bank High School": "Red Bank High School is a public school located in the city of Red Bank, Tennessee, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nRed Bank High School began as an extension to the one-year-old Red Bank Junior High School in 1938. Recognizing that the original plans for the school serving grades 7, 8, and 9 were not fulfilling the needs of the Red Bank community and surrounding areas, the Hamilton County Board of Education added a 10th grade in 1938, an 11th grade in 1939, and finally a 12th grade in 1940."}}
