{"Worcester": {"Eric Bostrom Three-Decker": "The Eric Bostrom Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 152 Eastern Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built about 1894, when Worcester's Belmont Hill area was rapidly growing with an influx of Scandinavian immigrants. When the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was noted for its elaborate Queen Anne porch woodwork, and eaves with decorative brackets."}}
