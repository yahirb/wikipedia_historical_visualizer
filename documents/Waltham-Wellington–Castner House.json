This 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1902, and is one of the last houses built on Trapelo Road before the advent of suburban subdivision of the area. The house has simple, vernacular, Queen Anne styling; it was built for Charles Lowell Wellington, whose family owned land in the area from the 17th century."}}
