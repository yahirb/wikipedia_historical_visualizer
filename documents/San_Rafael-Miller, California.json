{"San_Rafael": {"Miller, California": "Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court wherein the court redefined its definition of obscenity from that of \"utterly without socially redeeming value\" to that which lacks \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\". It is now referred to as the three-prong standard or the Miller test, with the third prong being informally known by the initialism and mnemonic device \"SLAPS\" or the term \"SLAPS test\"."}}
