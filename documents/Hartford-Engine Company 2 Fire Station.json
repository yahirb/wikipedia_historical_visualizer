{"Hartford": {"Engine Company 2 Fire Station": "The Engine Company 2 Fire Station is a firehouse at the corner of Main and Belden streets in Hartford, Connecticut, United States. It is a brick structure built in the early 20th century, the second firehouse built for the company. Architect Russell Barker, who designed many public buildings in the city, used the Italian Renaissance Revival style, unusual for a firehouse."}}
