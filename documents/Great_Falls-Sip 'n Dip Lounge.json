{"Great_Falls": {"Sip 'n Dip Lounge": "The Sip 'n Dip Lounge is a tiki bar in Great Falls, Montana opened in 1962, when Polynesian themes were popular, and it has survived to the present day with its tiki theme intact. Located inside a local motel that was considered modern and trendy at the time it was built, the Sip 'n Dip is known for having women dressed as mermaids swimming underwater in an indoor swimming pool visible through a window in the bar. Decorated with a bamboo ceiling and a South Seas theme, the bar also features \"Piano Pat\" Spoonheim, who has played piano there since 1963 and is noted for her unique \"jazzy\" style."}}
