{"Minneapolis": {"Minneapolis Skyway System": "The Minneapolis Skyway System is an interlinked collection of enclosed pedestrian footbridges that connect various buildings in 80 full city blocks over 11 miles (18 km) of Downtown Minneapolis, enabling people to walk in climate-controlled comfort year-round. It is the longest continuous system in the world. The skyways are owned by individual buildings in Minneapolis, and as such they do not have uniform opening and closing times."}}
