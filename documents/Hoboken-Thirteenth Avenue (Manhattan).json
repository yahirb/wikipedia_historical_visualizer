{"Hoboken": {"Thirteenth Avenue (Manhattan)": "Thirteenth Avenue is a street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, United States, built on landfill in 1837 along the Hudson River, though none of it remains. On an 1891 map published by G. W. Bromley, it is shown heading north from 11th Street to around 29th Street, where it became 12th Avenue.\nIn the early 20th century, New York wanted to build longer piers along the Hudson to accommodate bigger ships such as the RMS Lusitania and the RMS Titanic."}}
