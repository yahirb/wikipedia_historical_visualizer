{"Manchester": {"Varick Park": "Varick Park was an athletic complex located in Manchester, New Hampshire, from 1895 until 1913. It was constructed by local businessman Thomas Varick on land owned by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, partially on the site formerly occupied by a minor-league baseball park, the Beech Street Grounds. Consisting of a bicycle track, a baseball diamond, and two covered wooden grandstands (one for men, the other for men and women both), the park also hosted track-and-field events, football and soccer games, and outdoor events for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company."}}
