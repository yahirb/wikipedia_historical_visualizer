{"Athens-Clarke_County": {"40 Watt Club": "The 40 Watt Club is a music venue in Athens, Georgia. Along with CBGB's, the Whisky a Go Go, and selected others, it was instrumental in launching American punk rock and \"new wave music.\"\nThe 40 Watt Club had its origins as Curtis Crowe's College Avenue loft back in 1978. Bill Tabor and Curtis joked that it was a 40 Watt Club due to the single 40 Watt bulb which hung from the ceiling."}}
