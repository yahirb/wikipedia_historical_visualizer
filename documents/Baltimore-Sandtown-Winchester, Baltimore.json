{"Baltimore": {"Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore": "Sandtown-Winchester is a neighborhood in West Baltimore, Maryland. Known locally as Sandtown. The community's name was derived from the trails of sand that dropped from wagons leaving town after filling up at the local sand and gravel quarry back in the days of horse-drawn wagons."}}
