{"Jersey_City": {"Horseshoe, Jersey City": "The Horseshoe section of Jersey City, New Jersey was the second ward, and was the home of the immigrants, tenements, and taverns. The Republican-controlled Legislature gerrymandered the district in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes, thus preserving Republican dominance in the rest of the state. The curved shape of the district was said to resemble a horseshoe."}}
