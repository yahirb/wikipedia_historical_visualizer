{"Glendale": {"Sunset Sound Recorders": "Sunset Sound Recorders is a recording studio in Hollywood, California, United States located at 6650 Sunset Boulevard.\nThe Sunset Sound Recorders complex was created by Walt Disney's Director of Recording, Tutti Camarata, from a collection of old commercial and residential buildings. At the encouragement of Disney himself, Camarata began the project in 1958, starting with a former automotive repair garage whose sloping floor would tend to reduce unwanted sonic standing wave reflections."}}
