{"Garland": {"Spring Creek Forest Preserve": "The Spring Creek Forest Preserve is a city-owned nature preserve located in Garland, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1978, Bobby C. Scott, a self-taught botanist, recognized some plants in a section of woods in Garland, Texas as indicators of virgin forest. The existence of virgin forest within city limits is highly unusual, as the 19th Century settlers in the area typically cut down the forests for use in construction or to clear land for farming."}}
