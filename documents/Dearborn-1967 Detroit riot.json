{"Dearborn": {"1967 Detroit riot": "The 1967 Detroit riot, also known as the 12th Street riot or the 1967 Detroit rebellion, was the bloodiest race riot in the \"Long, hot summer of 1967\". Composed mainly of confrontations between black people and police, it began in the early morning hours of Sunday July 23, 1967 in Detroit, Michigan. The precipitating event was a police raid of an unlicensed, after-hours bar then known as a blind pig, on the city's Near West Side."}}
