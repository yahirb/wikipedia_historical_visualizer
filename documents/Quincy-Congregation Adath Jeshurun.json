{"Quincy": {"Congregation Adath Jeshurun": "Congregation Adath Jeshurun is a historic synagogue, now serving as a church, at 397 Blue Hill Avenue in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. As the Jewish community of Roxbury gradually moved away, its congregation dwindled and in 1967 it was sold to Ecclesia Apostolic. It was purchased by its present owner, the First Haitian Baptist Church, in 1978."}}
