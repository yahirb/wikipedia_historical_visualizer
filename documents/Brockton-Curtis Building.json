{"Brockton": {"Curtis Building": "The Curtis Building is a historic commercial building at 105-109 Main Street in Brockton, Massachusetts, USA. The three story brick building was built in 1870, and is a fine local example of Romanesque styling. It features panel brick pilasters on the corners, and panel brick decoration in the cornices. Its window bays (three on Main Street, five on High Street), consist of paired windows separated by brick piers; the third floor windows are set in double round-arch openings."}}
