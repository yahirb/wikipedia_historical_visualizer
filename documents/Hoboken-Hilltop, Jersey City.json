The name is a reflection of its location atop Bergen Hill, the southern portion of the Hudson Palisades, on either side of the cut, or excavated ravine, through which the Port Authority Trans Hudson rapid transit system travels, offering some streets views of Downtown Jersey City, the New York Skyline, and the Upper New York Bay.\nThe northern part of Hilltop is located to the east of Five Corners.The neighborhoods borders are created by other excavations, namely Bergen Arches, the Long Dock Tunnel, and The Depressed Highway."}}
