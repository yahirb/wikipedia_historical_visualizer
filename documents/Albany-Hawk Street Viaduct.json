{"Albany": {"Hawk Street Viaduct": "The Hawk Street Viaduct was a bridge spanning the Sheridan Hollow neighborhood in Albany, New York. Built in 1890, it was demolished in 1970 after decades of neglect which caused it to be limited to pedestrian traffic only in 1968. It was the first cantilever arch bridge in the world."}}
