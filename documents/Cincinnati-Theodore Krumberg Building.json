{"Cincinnati": {"Theodore Krumberg Building": "The Theodore Krumberg Building is a historic commercial building and former bank in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built in the Italianate style in 1871, the Krumberg Building is one of the most significant structures in Over-the-Rhine when considered from an architectural point of view, due to its size and its location at the intersection of Main and Twelfth Streets.\nTheodore Krumberg erected the present building in the early 1870s as a home for his dry goods store; part of the building was employed for retailing purposes, while other parts served as a warehouse for his business."}}
