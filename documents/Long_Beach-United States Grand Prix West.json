{"Long_Beach": {"United States Grand Prix West": "The United States Grand Prix West was a race held at Long Beach, California, as a Formula 5000 race in 1975 and a Formula One world championship event from 1976 to 1983 held in the same location throughout those years.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere had been an attempt to bring about a second American Formula One Grand Prix, specifically to sunny Southern California in 1972, with the United States Grand Prix West at the ultra modern Ontario Motor Speedway after the success of the Questor Grand Prix in 1971, but this was unsuccessful.\nWith the east coast Watkins Glen track on the downslope after two fatalities in successive years and a politically charged 1975 event, the USGP West was created for the 1976 season on a tight circuit made up of city streets in Long Beach, California, located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area on the west coast."}}
