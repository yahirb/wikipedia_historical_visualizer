The building, completed in 1887, was composed of three sections, and had a design which incorporated elements of the Eastlake and Queen Anne styles. The design included a corner turret, several gables along the roof line, and a variety of different window styles; it originally had three prominent oriel windows in the gable peaks above the bank's original section, and also had a set in the second section of the block."}}
