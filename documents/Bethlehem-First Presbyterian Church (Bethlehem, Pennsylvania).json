{"Bethlehem": {"First Presbyterian Church (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania)": "The First Presbyterian Church of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania was established in 1875, and the present building on Center Street was completed in 1957. The Church had 2,609 members as of June 2015 but the Presbyterian Church, like every mainline Protestant denomination, has suffered a decline in national membership, especially over the past decade.\nIn 2016, the elected leadership (the session) voted to break away from the national denomination, the Presbyterian Church (USA) or PC (USA) to join a new conservative body, the Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians or ECO. Points of contention between the two bodies hinge on acceptance of same sex issues by the national church, their involvement in social justice issues such as gun violence and the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict, and ECO's belief in Biblical literalism."}}
