{"Chicopee": {"Fitzgerald's Stearns Square Block": "Fitzgerald's Stearns Square Block was a historic commercial block at 300-308 Bridge Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. It was built in 1871 for Patrick Fitzgerald, one of Springfield's leading real estate developers of the time, and is an important early design of E.C. Gardner, who later designed a number of prominent Springfield properties. The three story brick building featured Italianate styling, and was the only remaining example of commercial Panel Brick construction in Springfield."}}
