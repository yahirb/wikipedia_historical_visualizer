{"Oakland": {"Sather Tower": "Sather Tower is a campanile (clock tower), with clocks on its four faces, on the University of California, Berkeley campus, more commonly known as The Campanile ( kamp-\u0259-NEE-lee) for its resemblance to the Campanile di San Marco in Venice. It is the university's most recognizable symbol. Given by Jane K. Sather in memory of her husband, banker Peder Sather, it is the third-tallest bell-and-clock-tower in the world."}}
