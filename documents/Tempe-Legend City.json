{"Tempe": {"Legend City": "Legend City was an amusement park that existed on the border of Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona, from its opening in 1963 to its closing and demolition in 1983.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally conceived as an Old West theme park in the mold of Disneyland by Phoenix artist and advertising agency owner Louis E. Crandall, Legend City endured a series of closings, bankruptcies and ownership changes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and was never a significant financial success. Nevertheless, Legend City is still remembered fondly and held in high regard by locals who knew and frequented the park in its heyday."}}
