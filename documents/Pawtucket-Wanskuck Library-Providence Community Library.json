{"Pawtucket": {"Wanskuck Library-Providence Community Library": "The Wanskuck Library\u2014Providence Community Library is an historic branch library building at 233 Veazie Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a single-story brick and stone structure, built in 1928, replacing an earlier library building which had originally housed a library established by the Wanskuck Mill Company for its employees. The building was designed by Clarke & Howe, and is an excellent local example of Colonial Revival design, with a tetrastyle entrance portico."}}
