{"Kingsport": {"Sullivan Gardens, Tennessee": "Sullivan Gardens is an unincorporated community in southwestern Sullivan County, Tennessee, located southwest of Kingsport. Since the 1990s, Sullivan Gardens has experienced a decline, due mainly to the construction of the Sullivan Gardens Parkway, which re-routed Highway 93, and resulted in traffic being routed around, rather than through, the town, leading to the eventual closure of a number of small businesses. Prior to the late 1990s, there were a number of small, locally owned stores and businesses along the old Highway 93 in the town of Sullivan Gardens, including gas stations, a plant nursery, pharmacy, and hardware store."}}
