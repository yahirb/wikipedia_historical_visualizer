{"Pawtucket": {"John F. Adams House": "The John F. Adams House, listed incorrectly as the John E. Adams House by the National Register of Historic Places, is a historic house at 11 Allen Avenue in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The house's unique exterior and architecture was described in the multiple property submission which described it as the \"finest late Italianate dwelling still standing in Pawtucket.\" Its design is similar to the dwellings designed by Henry Austin and features Moorish window hoods and Indian porch columns. The John F. Adams House was moved back 50 feet (15 m) and turned to face Allen Avenue after it was purchased by the Beacon Oil Company in 1929."}}
