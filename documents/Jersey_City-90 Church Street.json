The building takes up a full block between Church Street and West Broadway and between Vesey and Barclay Streets in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan. The AIA Guide to New York City says about the building: \"A boring limestone monolith that has trouble deciding between a heritage of stripped down neo-Classical and a new breath of Art Deco.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n90 Church Street was designed by Cross & Cross, Pennington, Lewis & Mills and Louis A. Simon, who was Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury at the time."}}
