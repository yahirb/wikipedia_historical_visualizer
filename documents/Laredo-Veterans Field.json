{"Laredo": {"Veterans Field": "Veterans Field is a baseball venue in Laredo, Texas. Built in 1950, the park was formerly known as West Martin Field, but the field's name was changed to honor the men and women who have served defending America in the armed forces. Home to many teams over the years, it was renovated in 2002, and now seats 5,000 with concessions and two picnic areas."}}
