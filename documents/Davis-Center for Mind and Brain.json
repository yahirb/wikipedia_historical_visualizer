{"Davis": {"Center for Mind and Brain": "The UCD Center for Mind and Brain is a research and training unit at the University of California, Davis dedicated to understanding the nature of the human mind from interdisciplinary perspectives.\nScientists currently in the CMB (19 core members), and those who will be recruited to join it, include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how our minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from social science (anthropology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology), biological science (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, physiology), engineering science (biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science), and medical science (neurology, psychiatry and medical imaging)."}}
