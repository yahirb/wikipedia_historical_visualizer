{"Boston": {"Modern Theatre (Boston)": "The Modern Theatre on Washington Street in Boston, Massachusetts was first opened in 1876 as the Dobson Building, designed by Levi Newcomb. It was renovated in 1914 as a movie theatre by architect Clarence Blackall; by 1980 it had fallen into neglect and dilapidation. In 2009-2010 Suffolk University demolished the theatre but retained the original facade of theatre, and constructed a new building on the site."}}
