{"North_Charleston": {"Daniel Ravenel House": "The Daniel Ravenel House has remained in the same family longer than any other house in Charleston, South Carolina. The property itself was first owned by the current owner's family when Isaac Mazyck acquired the land, probably in about 1710; he definitely owned the parcel by 1719. When he died in 1735, his daughter inherited the house, and it became her home along with her husband, Daniel Ravenel."}}
