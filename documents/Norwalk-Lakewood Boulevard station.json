{"Norwalk": {"Lakewood Boulevard station": "Lakewood Boulevard (or Lakewood/I-105) is a Los Angeles County Metro Rail station on the Green Line. It is located in the center median of Century Freeway at the interchange with Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. It is not necessarily named for the city of Lakewood, California (to the south) as Metro Rail usually names most of their stations after the nearest major cross streets."}}
