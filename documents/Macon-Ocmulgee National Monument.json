{"Macon": {"Ocmulgee National Monument": "Ocmulgee National Monument preserves traces of over ten millennia of Southeastern Native American culture, including major earthworks built before 1000 CE by the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture.) These include the Great Temple and other ceremonial mounds, a burial mound, and defensive trenches. They represented highly skilled engineering techniques and soil knowledge, and the organization of many laborers. The site has evidence of \"17,000 years of continuous human habitation.\" The 702-acre (2.84 km2) park is located on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River."}}
