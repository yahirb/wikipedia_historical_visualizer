{"North_Little_Rock": {"Hanger Hill Historic District": "The Hanger Hill Historic District encompasses a collection of early 20th-century residential properties on the 1500 block of Welch Street (between 15th and 16th Streets) in Little Rock, Arkansas. Included are nine historic houses and one carriage barn, the latter a remnant of a property whose main house was destroyed by fire in 1984. The houses are all either Colonial Revival or Queen Anne Victorian, or share some stylistic elements of both architectural styles, and were built between 1906 and 1912."}}
