{"Jackson": {"Jackson Volcano": "Jackson Volcano is an extinct volcano 2900 feet (884 meters) beneath the city of Jackson, Mississippi, under the Mississippi Coliseum. The uplifted terrain around the volcano forms the Jackson Dome, an area of dense rock clearly noticeable in local gravity measurements. E.W. Hilgard published his theory of an anticline beneath Jackson in 1860 due to his observations of surface strata.The dome contains relatively pure carbon dioxide which is used in oil production in Gulf Coast oil fields."}}
