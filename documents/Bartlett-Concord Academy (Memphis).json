{"Bartlett": {"Concord Academy (Memphis)": "Concord Academy is a private, state approved, non-profit school (Grades 6-12) for students with special needs such as learning disabilities, attention deficits and many other problems that prevent students from learning in a regular class setting or school. Sometimes the students they serve are challenged with a single,or more special learning consideration or a defined social-emotional need. Much more often, however, these children face a combination of disabling factors that require modifications in all subject areas and a variety of programs to address unique needs."}}
