{"Newton": {"Evergreen Cemetery (Boston, Massachusetts)": "Evergreen Cemetery is a historic cemetery in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It was established in 1850 by the town of Brighton (which was annexed to Boston in 1874), and was laid out in the then-fashionable rural cemetery style inspired by Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Its entrance gate was built in 1892, and its Jacobethan office building was added in 1903."}}
