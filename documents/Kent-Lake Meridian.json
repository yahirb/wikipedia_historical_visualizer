{"Kent": {"Lake Meridian": "Lake Meridian is a fresh-water lake located in the city of Kent, Washington. One among the few lakes in King County allowing motorized boating, Lake Meridian is an urban lake, surrounded by homes and located just off the Kent-Kangley Road on Kent's East Hill.\nFed primarily by springs at the west end of the lake, Lake Meridian empties at the east end of the lake into a small stream that eventually connects to the Little Soos Creek, which in turn eventually feeds into the larger Green River via a number of other streams and eventually ends up in Elliott Bay."}}
