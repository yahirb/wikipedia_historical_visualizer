{"New_York": {"Marine Midland Building": "The Marine Midland Building (also known as HSBC Bank Building) is a 51-story office building located at 140 Broadway between Cedar and Liberty streets in Manhattan's financial district. The building, completed in 1967, is 688 ft (209.7 m) tall and is known for the distinctive sculpture at its entrance, Isamu Noguchi's Cube. Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the man who designed the building, had originally proposed a monolith type sculpture, but it was deemed to be too expensive. It is currently owned by Union Investment.\nThe building is approximately 688 feet (210 m) high, measuring approximately 1,170,000 rentable square feet (111,000 square meters). The primary tenant of the building as of 2010 is Brown Brothers Harriman, leasing some 430,000 ft\u00b2 (40,000 m\u00b2) in 2003. BBH moved to the site from their trademark location at 59 Wall Street, filling a vacancy left after HSBC moved their primary New York offices out of the building, to the HSBC building at 452 5th Avenue."}}
