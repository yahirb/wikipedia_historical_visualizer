{"Portland": {"Inversion: Plus Minus": "Inversion: Plus Minus (sometimes stylized as Inversion +/-) is a pair of outdoor sculptures designed by artists and architects Annie Han and Daniel Mihalyo, located in southeast Portland, Oregon. The sculptures, constructed from weathered steel angle iron, are sited near the Morrison Bridge and Hawthorne Bridge along Southeast Grand Avenue and represent \"ghosts\" of former buildings. The installation on Belmont Street emphasizes \"negative space\" while the sculpture on Hawthorne Street appears as a more solid matrix of metal."}}
