{"Weymouth_Town": {"Faith Lutheran Church (Quincy, Massachusetts)": "Faith Lutheran Church, formerly known as Salem Lutheran Church, is a historic church at 199 Granite Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The church was built in 1894 to serve a growing congregation of Scandinavians who had come to Quincy to work in its granite quarries. The stones for this granite Gothic Revival church building were hauled and dressed by members of the congregation."}}
