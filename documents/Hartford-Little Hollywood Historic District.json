{"Hartford": {"Little Hollywood Historic District": "The Little Hollywood Historic District encompasses a concentrated collection of apartment buildings built mainly between the world wars in the Asylum Hill neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut. Located on Farmington Avenue and Owen, Frederick, and Denison Streets, they were built primarily to attract single tenants seeking small apartments, a trend that developed after World War I and ended after World War II. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nHartford's Asylum Hill neighborhood, located west of the city center, was for many years a fashionable address, where handsome houses and small estates were built for the city's business, political, and cultural elite."}}
