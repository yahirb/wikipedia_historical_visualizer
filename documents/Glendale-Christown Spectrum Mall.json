{"Glendale": {"Christown Spectrum Mall": "Chris-Town Mall is the oldest operating mall and was the third shopping mall built in Phoenix, Arizona, located on Bethany Home Road and 19th Avenue. The property currently is known as Christown Spectrum Mall, derived from Chris-Town Mall and Phoenix Spectrum Mall, names previously used in the past. Today it exists as an enclosed shopping mall, although the enclosed portion of the mall was greatly reduced when redevelopment changed the configuration closer to a power centre."}}
