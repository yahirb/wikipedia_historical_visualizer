{"Franklin": {"Nashville Tennessee Temple": "The Nashville Tennessee Temple is the 84th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\nThe temple originally was to be built in the affluent Forest Hills, but the plan was turned down by city commissioners due to zoning rules. It was eventually built next to an existing meetinghouse about twenty miles (32 km) southwest of Nashville."}}
