{"Jersey_City": {"Create Charter High School": "CREATE Charter High School was a four-year public high school that operated under a charter granted by the New Jersey Commissioner of Education. The school was run independently of the Jersey City Public Schools since it opened in September 2001 and was shut down in June 2010 after receiving notice from Acting Commissioner of Education Bret Schundler that the charter would be withdrawn as the school had failed to achieve its goals, including having less than 5% of graduating seniors reaching the proficient level on the language arts and mathematics components of the High School Proficiency Assessment.\nCREATE Charter High School was a public school open to all students on a space-available basis."}}
