{"New_Orleans": {"Country Club Gardens": "Country Club Gardens is a residential neighborhood in Planning District Five (D5) of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States comprising homes along six streets:\nBamboo Road\nBellaire Drive\nFairway Drive\nGarden Lane\nMaryland Drive\nMetairie Road\nThe area is bound to the north by the Lakewood neighborhood, and is separated from that area by the raised right-of-way of the Norfolk Southern Railway; to the east by the Metairie Cemetery and the golf course of the New Orleans Country Club; and, to the south and West, by the 17th Street Canal, one of the main arteries draining rain water out of the city and north to Lake Pontchartrain. Because of the physical location and the street network, the neighborhood enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in the city of New Orleans.\nThe Metairie Ridge, a natural levee formation of the Bayou Metairie (no longer extant, except in City Park) along whose course Metairie Road now proceeds, trends through the neighborhood and provides above-sea-level elevation for much of the land situated within a quarter of a mile of Metairie Road."}}
