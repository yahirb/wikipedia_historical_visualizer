{"Peoria": {"Bob Michel Bridge": "The Bob Michel Bridge carries Illinois Route 40 over the Illinois River just .75 miles (1.21 km) up-river from the Cedar Street Bridge. Illinois 40 terminates at an interchange with Interstate 74 just east of the bridge. The bridge serves as a direct surface route from a major commercial center in East Peoria to the Civic Center in downtown Peoria."}}
