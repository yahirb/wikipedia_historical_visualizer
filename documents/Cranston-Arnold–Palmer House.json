{"Cranston": {"Arnold\u2013Palmer House": "The Arnold\u2013Palmer House is an historic house at 33 Chestnut Street in Providence, Rhode Island. The Federal style house built in 1826 at a location on upper Westminster Street, where it was one of four nearly identical houses whose design was attributed to prominent local architect John Holden Greene by preservationist Norman Isham. This house is the only one of the four still standing, having been moved to its present location in 1967 as part of the Weybosset Hill urban redevelopment project."}}
