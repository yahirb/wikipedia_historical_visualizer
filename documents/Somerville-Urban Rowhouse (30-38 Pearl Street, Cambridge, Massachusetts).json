{"Somerville": {"Urban Rowhouse (30-38 Pearl Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts)": "The Urban Rowhouse is an historic rowhouse located at 30-38 Pearl Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Built in 1874, this was one of the earliest masonry rowhouses to be built in Cambridge. Stylistically, the three story brick buildings are in a Ruskinian Gothic style, with horizontal bands of colored brick, hooded window lintels, a corbelled cornice, and a steeply-pitched mansard roof with gabled dormers."}}
