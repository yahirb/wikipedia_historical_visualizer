{"Burbank": {"Tuna Canyon Detention Station": "Tuna Canyon Detention Station was a temporary detention facility used for holding enemy aliens who were considered (incorrectly) by the U.S. government to be risks to national security. The detention camp was located in Tujunga at a former Civilian Conservation (CCC) Camp, constructed in 1933. The camp was converted into the Tuna Canyon Detention Station just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor."}}
