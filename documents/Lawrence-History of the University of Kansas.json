{"Lawrence": {"History of the University of Kansas": "The history of the University of Kansas can be traced back to 1855, when efforts were begun to establish a \"University of the Territory of Kansas.\" Nine years later in 1864, together with the help of Amos Adams Lawrence, former Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson, and several other prominent figures, the Kansas Legislature chartered the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The university was initially funded by a $15,000 endowment on a 40-acre (160,000 m2) allotment of land from Charles Robinson and his wife Sara. The university commenced preparatory-level classes in 1866 and college-level classes in 1869."}}
