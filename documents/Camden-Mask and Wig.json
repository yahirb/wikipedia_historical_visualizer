{"Camden": {"Mask and Wig": "The Mask and Wig Club, a private club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1889, is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in the United States. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the University of Pennsylvania, Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and audiences across the country. Its credo is \"Justice to the stage; credit to the University.\"\nThe club's performers, or \"The Cast,\" put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club's own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff."}}
