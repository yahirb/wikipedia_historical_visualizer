{"Glendale": {"Maryvale, Phoenix": "Maryvale is an urban village of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlans for Maryvale began to take shape during the 1950s, when developer John F. Long came up with the idea of developing a master-planned community on the western part of Phoenix, with an aim of turning the area into a working class suburb for Caucasians. It was the first master planned community in Arizona, and one of the first planned communities in the country."}}
