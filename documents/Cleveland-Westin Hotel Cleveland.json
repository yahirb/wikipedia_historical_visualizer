{"Cleveland": {"Westin Hotel Cleveland": "The Westin Hotel Cleveland is a modernist 1975-opened 222 foot, 22 story, 484 room Westin high-rise hotel in downtown Cleveland in the city's Civic Center district. The tower rooms sit on top of a multi-story built-in parking garage.The hotel sits along St. Clair Avenue and features rainbow lighting running length wise along its multilevel parking deck at night. This is the only Westin high-end hotel in Cleveland, the other two in the state being in Cincinnati and Columbus.\nOriginally, in the 1990s there was to be a Westin Hotel built in Cleveland in The Flats and was to have 416 rooms, however this project never materialized. The Westin here then completes plans to have a Westin present in the central city since at least the late 1980s."}}
