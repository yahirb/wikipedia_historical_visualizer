{"Arvada": {"Denver Millennium Bridge": "For other structures of the same name see Millennium Bridge (disambiguation)\nThe Denver Millennium Bridge is the world\u2019s first cable-stayed bridge using post-tensioned structural construction. Its 200-foot (61m) white tapered steel mast rises above Denver\u2019s northwestern skyline, connected to the bridge deck and foundation anchors by steel cables. This unique footbridge crosses railroad tracks and the regional light rail system, climbing no higher than 25 feet (8m) above street level, thereby minimizing the height pedestrians must climb."}}
