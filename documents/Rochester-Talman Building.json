{"Rochester": {"Talman Building": "The Talman Building is a historic site at 25 E. Main Street, Rochester, New York, used as an office by the outspoken African-American Frederick Douglass in editing and publishing the abolitionist journal, The North Star from 1847 to 1863.\nIt was also a stop on the Underground Railroad, and Douglass gave asylum to many traveling fugitives, of which at least one party was led by Harriet Tubman. It is named the Talman Building (also listed as the Talman Hall) after John T. Talman purchased the plot in 1839."}}
