{"Honolulu": {"Nu\u2018uanu Pali Tunnels": "The Nu\u02bbuanu Pali Tunnels are a set of four highway tunnels (two in each direction) on the Pali Highway (Hawaii Route 61) which pass through the Nu\u02bbuanu Pali. These tunnels serve as one of three trans-Ko\u02bbolau routes between Honolulu (leeward O\u02bbahu) and the communities of windward O\u02bbahu. Also, the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels serve as a major transportation route from Kaneohe and Kailua over to Honolulu."}}
