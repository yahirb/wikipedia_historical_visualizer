{"North_Charleston": {"John Fullerton House": "The John Fullerton House was designed and built by Scottish master builder John Fullerton some time after he bought the land on December 31, 1772 and before he resold it at a much higher cost in 1777. Among the notable features of the house are the highly decorative window casings on the first and second floor; the console brackets and hoods reflect a high style that can be found on other notable houses of the same period in Charleston. The house is built of cypress."}}
