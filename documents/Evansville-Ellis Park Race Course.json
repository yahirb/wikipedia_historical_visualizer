{"Evansville": {"Ellis Park Race Course": "Ellis Park is a thoroughbred racetrack in Henderson, Kentucky, just south of Evansville, Indiana. While the track is located north of the Ohio River that forms the border between Kentucky and Indiana, which would put it within Indiana, the border is based on the course of the river at the time Kentucky became a state in 1792.\n\n\n== History ==\nEllis Park was built by the Green River Jockey Club in 1922."}}
