{"Pittsburg": {"Cornwall, California": "Cornwall, formerly known as Cornwall Station, was an unincorporated community in Contra Costa County, California, before it was absorbed into the City of Pittsburg. It was located 7.25 miles (11.67 km) east-southeast of Baypoint and 1 mile (1.6 km) south of downtown Pittsburg, at an elevation of 39 feet (12 m) ASL.\nThe area appears to have been named after Pierre Barlow Cornwall who was an early California pioneer and president of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company at nearby Nortonville, California from 1872 to 1904. Cornwall sprung up at the intersection of two railroads, the Black Diamond Coal Mining Railroad and the San Pablo and Tulare Railroad, (the latter became part of the Southern Pacific system in 1888)."}}
