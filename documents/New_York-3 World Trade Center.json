{"New_York": {"3 World Trade Center": "3 World Trade Center (also known as 175 Greenwich Street) is a skyscraper under construction as part of the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It's located on the east side of the new World Trade Center complex, between where the old 4 & 5 WTC buildings were, and not on the site of the old 3 World Trade Center, which was in the southwest corner. The project lies on the east side of Greenwich Street, across the street from the previous location of the Twin Towers, which were destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001. Pritzker Prize-winning architect Richard Rogers, of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, was awarded the contract to design the building, which will have a height of 1,079 ft (329 m) with 80 stories. The building's concrete core was topped out to maximum height in August 2016, with the perimeter steel structure topped out on October 6, 2016. The building is scheduled to be completed in 2018.\nThe previous 3 World Trade Center was the Marriott World Trade Center, although this was located in the southwest corner of the World Trade Center complex until its destruction on September 11, 2001. It was a 22-story steel-frame hotel with 825 rooms. It had a roof height of 242 feet (74 m). Construction began in 1979 and it opened in July 1981 as the Vista International Hotel."}}
