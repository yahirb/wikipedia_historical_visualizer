{"Yonkers": {"Hackensack Township, New Jersey": "Hackensack Township was a township that was formed in 1693 within Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The township was created by the New Jersey Legislature as one of the first group of townships in New Jersey. Bergen County, which had been created in 1682, was thus split into two parts: Hackensack Township to the north, and Bergen Township to the south."}}
