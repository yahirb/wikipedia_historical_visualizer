{"New_Brunswick": {"Albany Street Bridge": "The Albany Street Bridge is a bridge that carries Route 27 in the U.S. state of New Jersey spanning the Raritan River. The bridge connects Highland Park on the east with New Brunswick on the west. The bridge is so named because Route 27 in New Brunswick, from the Raritan River to Easton Avenue, is known locally as Albany Street."}}
