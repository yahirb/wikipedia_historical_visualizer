{"Boston": {"Milk Street, Boston": "Milk Street is a street in the financial district of Boston, Massachusetts. It was one of Boston's earliest highways. The name \"Milk Street\" was most likely given to the street in 1708 due to a milk market at the location, although Grace Croft's 1952 work \"History and Genealogy of Milk Family\" instead proposes that Milk Street may have been named for John Milk, an early shipwright in Boston. The land was originally conveyed to his father, also John Milk, in October 1666.\nOne of the first post offices in Boston was located on the street in 1711, when the first regular postal routes to Maine, Plymouth and New York were established."}}
