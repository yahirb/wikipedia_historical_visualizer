{"New_York": {"Theatre Alley": "Not to be confused with the Alley Theatre (Strabane) in Northern Ireland.\nThe Alley Theatre is a Tony Award-winning indoor theatre in Downtown Houston, Texas, and hosts two stages. The \"Hubbard\" is the main stage with seating for 774; the more intimate \"Neuhaus\" seats 310. Nine towers and open-air terraces give the Alley Theatre a castle-like quality. Inside, a staircase spirals from the entrance vestibule to the second-floor lobby. A wide variety of plays have been performed in this theater."}}
