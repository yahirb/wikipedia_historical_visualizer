{"Newton": {"Lewis Cabot Estate": "The Lewis Cabot Estate was a historic estate at Warren and Heath Streets in Brookline, Massachusetts. The estate, developed in 1894, was one of few surviving turn-of-the-century properties of the Boston Brahmin Cabot family, and a prominent local example of Jacobethan architecture with landscaping by Frederic Law Olmsted. The remnant portion of the estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; the main house has since been demolished."}}
