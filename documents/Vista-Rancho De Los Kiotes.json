{"Vista": {"Rancho De Los Kiotes": "Rancho De Los Kiotes (literal translation: Ranch of the Spanish Daggers) near Carlsbad, California was a weekend retreat for actor Leo Carrillo, who designed the property in the style of Spanish hacienda estates. Situated on land once inhabited by the Luise\u00f1o people, the original 2,538 acres (1,027 ha) were located on an old Spanish land grant. Carrillo purchased 1,700 acres (690 ha) for $17 an acre in 1937, adding additional acreage two years later."}}
