{"Camden": {"Foundation for Individual Rights in Education": "The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) is a non-profit, non-partisan group founded in 1999 that focuses on civil liberties in academia in the United States. Its goal is \"to defend and sustain individual rights at America's colleges and universities,\" including the rights to \"freedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience\".\nOne of FIRE's main activities has been criticism of university administrators whose activities have, in FIRE's view, violated the free speech or due process rights of college and university students and professors under the First Amendment and/or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution."}}
