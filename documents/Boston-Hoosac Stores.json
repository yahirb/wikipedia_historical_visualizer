{"Boston": {"Hoosac Stores": "The Hoosac Stores is a historic warehouse at 115 Constitution Road (formerly Water Street) in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Originally designated Hoosac Stores 1 & 2, it is a six-story load-bearing brick warehouse, set just outside the gate of the Boston Navy Yard. A second, adjacent warehouse, identified as Hoosac Stores 3, was demolished in 2000 because it was structurally unsound."}}
