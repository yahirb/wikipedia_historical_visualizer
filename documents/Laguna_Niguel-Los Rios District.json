{"Laguna_Niguel": {"Los Rios District": "The Los Rios Historic District is a neighborhood in the city of San Juan Capistrano, California and, with buildings dating to 1794, is the oldest continually occupied neighborhood in the state. The nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano was the first of the 21 California Missions to have Indians, soldiers and workers live outside the mission grounds. Three adobes are remaining in the Los Rios neighborhood itself, although there are a number of others close by outside of it which were part of what was once a larger neighborhood."}}
