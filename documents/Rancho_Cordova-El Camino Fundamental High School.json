{"Rancho_Cordova": {"El Camino Fundamental High School": "El Camino Fundamental High School is a public high school in Sacramento, California in the San Juan Unified School District. Built in 1950 as El Camino High School, \"Fundamental\" was added to the name in the late 1970s to signify the school's intention to focus upon basic (fundamental) characteristics of successful schools, in particular a return to a strong disciplinary emphasis, a stripped-down college preparatory curriculum, and a contract-supported, enroll-through-application-only process.\nAcademically, as measured by their Academic Performance Index, El Camino finally broke the important \"800\" barrier in 2009 after two years of changes implemented by its former principal, Mike Stockdale."}}
