{"Quincy": {"Faxon House": "The Faxon House is a historic house at 310 Adams Street in Quincy, Massachusetts. The oldest portion of this house was built in 1880 by Job Faxon, a Boston-based flour merchant. His son Henry retained the Boston firm of Shepard and Stearns, and expanded and redesigned the house in Colonial Revival style in 1931, a time when larger estates on Adams Street were being subdivided for development."}}
