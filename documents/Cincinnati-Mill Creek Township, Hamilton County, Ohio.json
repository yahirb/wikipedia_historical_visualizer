{"Cincinnati": {"Mill Creek Township, Hamilton County, Ohio": "Mill Creek Township (or Millcreek Township) is a township of south-central Hamilton County, Ohio that was largely absorbed in the late Nineteenth century by the annexation of suburban villages and outlying settlements by the City of Cincinnati. It extends north from the Ohio River along both banks of the Mill Creek after which it was named. As the original site of Fort Washington and the settlement of Cincinnati, references to it are frequently encountered by genealogists."}}
