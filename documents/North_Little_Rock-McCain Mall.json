{"North_Little_Rock": {"McCain Mall": "McCain Mall is the largest enclosed shopping mall by leasable area in the Little Rock metropolitan area, located near Interstate 40 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The shopping hub was officially dedicated in April 1973, although its primary anchor, Little Rock-based Pfiefer-Blass, had opened for business in late 1972. Among its 80 stores and services were a J.G. McCrory 5 and 10 and McCain Mall Cinema I and II. The shopping center was the largest in the state until an addition was completed as Fort Smith's Central Mall in 1986."}}
