{"Miramar": {"Waldrep Dairy Farm": "The Waldrep Dairy Farm, established in 1928, was the last functional dairy farm in Broward County and Miami-Dade County within the state of Florida until its closure in 2005. With much of the South Florida region finding its roots as farm, it served as a landmark and reminder of Broward County's past. At its peak, the farm's reach included many sections of what is now the City of Cooper City, eastern sections of the City of Pembroke Pines, western sections of the City of Hollywood and some areas of the Town of Davie."}}
