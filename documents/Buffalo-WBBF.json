{"Buffalo": {"WBBF": "WBBF (1120 AM) is a radio station located in Buffalo, New York and broadcasting at a frequency of 1120 kHz on the AM band with a daytime power of 1000 watts.\nThe station is owned by Cumulus Media (which bought stations from Citadel Broadcasting) and is operated under a Lease Management Agreement.\nThe WBBF call sign is perhaps better known and remembered in upstate New York for its long association with a Rochester, NY radio station, now known as WROC, which for many years was that city's main top-40 radio station and its ratings leader from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s."}}
