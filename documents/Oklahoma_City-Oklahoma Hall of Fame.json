{"Oklahoma_City": {"Oklahoma Hall of Fame": "The Oklahoma Memorial Association was founded in 1927 by Anna B. Korn with the purpose of establishing the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. Being inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame is the highest honor one can receive from the state. In the 1970s, the Hefner Mansion was donated to the association to house the exhibits and busts or portraits of the inductees, and the organization changed its name to the Oklahoma Heritage Association in 1971."}}
