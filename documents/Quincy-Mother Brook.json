{"Quincy": {"Mother Brook": "Mother Brook is a stream that flows from the Charles River in Dedham, Massachusetts, to the Neponset River in the Hyde Park section of Boston, Massachusetts. Mother Brook was also known variously as East Brook and Mill Creek in earlier times. Digging the brook made Boston and some surrounding communities an island, accessible only by crossing over water, making Mother Brook \"Massachusetts' Panama Canal.\"\nDug by English settlers in 1639, it is the first man-made canal in the United States."}}
