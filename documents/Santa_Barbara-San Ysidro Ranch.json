{"Santa_Barbara": {"San Ysidro Ranch": "The San Ysidro Ranch is a luxury hotel and resort located in the Montecito foothills, at the foot of the Santa Ynez Mountain range. Originally deeded with the Presidio by Charles III of Spain, the San Ysidro Ranch exchanged hands, changing from a Mission farm, to a Citrus Ranch, to the hotel it is today. Acquired by Ty Warner in 2000, the Ranch underwent a massive remodel."}}
