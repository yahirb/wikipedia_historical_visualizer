{"Camden": {"Liberty Bell": "The Liberty Bell is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Once placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House (now renamed Independence Hall), the bell today is located in the Liberty Bell Center in Independence National Historical Park. The bell was commissioned in 1752 by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from the London firm of Lester and Pack (known subsequently as the Whitechapel Bell Foundry), and was cast with the lettering \"Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof,\" a Biblical reference from the Book of Leviticus (25:10)."}}
