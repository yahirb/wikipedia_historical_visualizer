{"Bayonne": {"Ward Hill, Staten Island": "Ward Hill is the name of a neighborhood located in the northeastern part of Staten Island, which is one of the five boroughs of New York City, the United States's largest city.\nWard Hill is the northernmost of a chain of hills that stretch approximately halfway across Staten Island, which at one point (on Todt Hill, toward the southern end of the chain) rises to 410 feet (125 m), the highest elevation found that close to the seabord south of Maine in the eastern United States.\nNamed for Caleb T. Ward, who purchased property at the top of the hill in 1826, Ward Hill has long been home to the island's local political elite."}}
