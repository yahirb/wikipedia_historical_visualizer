{"Portland": {"Union Bank Tower": "The Union Bank Tower (stylized as UnionBank Tower), formerly known as the Union Bank of California Tower and originally as the Bank of California building (not to be confused with the older Bank of California Building), is an 82 m (269 ft), 15-story office building completed in 1969 in downtown Portland, Oregon. It was briefly the tallest building in the city when it topped-out in 1968, but was soon eclipsed by the Georgia-Pacific Building (now Standard Insurance Center).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe tower was built for the Bank of California, to house its Portland operations, which had outgrown their space in the historic Bank of California Building in which they had been based since 1925, located just over one block to the east."}}
