{"Lynn": {"Point Neighborhood Historic District": "The Point Neighborhood Historic District, also known as Stage Point, is a predominantly residential historic district just south of downtown Salem, Massachusetts. It is a densely built, roughly rectangular grid of streets east of Lafayette Street, south of the South River, west of Congress Street, and north of Chase and Leavitt Streets. This area was the target of a major redevelopment effort undertaken by the city after a fire swept through it in 1914."}}
