{"Mission_Viejo": {"El Toro Y": "The El Toro \"Y\" is a freeway interchange in southern Orange County, California where the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), and the San Diego Freeway, the I-405 merge. South of that point, it retains the name \"San Diego Freeway\" but with the highway designation \"I-5.\" Located in south Orange County where the cities of Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, and Irvine converge, the interchange was named after the city (El Toro - now Lake Forest) and the now closed Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, located northeast of the interchange.\nThe \"Y\" is one of the busiest interchanges in the world; from 1975 to 2002, daily traffic surged from 102,000 to 356,000 vehicles a day."}}
