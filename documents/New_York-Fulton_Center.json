{"New_York": {"Fulton Center": "The Fulton Center is a transit center and retail complex centered at the intersection of Fulton Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The complex is part of a $1.4 billion project by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), a public agency of the state of New York, to rehabilitate the Fulton Street New York City Subway station, and construct new underground passageways and access points into the complex. The complex officially opened on November 10, 2014, along with the Dey Street Passageway.\nThe project is intended to improve access to and connections among the New York City Subway services stopping at the Fulton Street station and, through the Dey Street Passageway to the World Trade Center mall, PATH station, and observation deck, and provide connections to the Chambers Street\u2013World Trade Center/Park Place, Cortlandt Street (1 and \u200b2), and Cortlandt Street (N, \u200bR, and \u200bW) stations, as well as the PATH World Trade Center station. Funding for the construction project, which began in 2005, dried up for several years, with no final approved plan and no schedule for completion. Plans for the transit center, however, were rejuvenated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Retail is provided by Westfield.\nIt used to be referred to as the Fulton Street Transit Center, but was rebranded the Fulton Center in May 2012 because of a heightened emphasis on retail."}}
