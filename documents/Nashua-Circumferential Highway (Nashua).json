{"Nashua": {"Circumferential Highway (Nashua)": "The Circumferential Highway is the commonly accepted name for a bypass route around the city of Nashua in southern New Hampshire, the majority of which has not yet been built. The purpose of the highway is to provide an alternate route for commuters to access the F.E. Everett Turnpike and U.S. Route 3 in Nashua. Most of the highway will be built in Hudson, with small sections also built through the towns of Litchfield and Merrimack as well as the city of Nashua."}}
