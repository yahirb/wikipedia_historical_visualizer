{"Portland": {"North Park Blocks": "The North Park Blocks form a city park in downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States.\nCaptain John H. Couch deeded the five blocks to the city in 1865, and they were officially platted for a municipal park in 1869. An ordinance was passed in 1904, setting aside one park block for women and children."}}
