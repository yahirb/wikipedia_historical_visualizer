{"Burbank": {"Woodbury University": "Woodbury University is a private, non-profit, coeducational, nonsectarian university located in Burbank, Los Angeles County; and a satellite campus in San Diego, both in Southern California. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees from four schools: Architecture; Business; Media, Culture & Design; and Liberal Arts. In recent years, declining enrollment has stressed operating performance for this highly tuition dependent university."}}
