{"Hartford": {"Capewell Horse Nail Company": "The Capewell Horse Nail Company is a historic brick industrial complex located in the Hartford, Connecticut neighborhood of Sheldon/Charter Oak. It was built in 1903 by industrialist George Capewell at the corner of Charter Oak Avenue and Popieluszko Court after the previous headquarters burned down.\nTwenty years earlier, in 1881, Capewell invented a machine that efficiently manufactured horseshoe nails, and his success made Hartford the \"horseshoe nail capitol\" of the world."}}
