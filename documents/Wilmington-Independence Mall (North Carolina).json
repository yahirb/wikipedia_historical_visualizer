{"Wilmington": {"Independence Mall (North Carolina)": "Independence Mall (formerly Westfield Independence) is the only enclosed shopping mall in Wilmington, North Carolina. It opened in 1979 with anchor stores Belk-Beery (now Belk), JCPenney, and Sears. A later expansion added a new wing and Dillard's store to the center after Westfield Group purchased the mall."}}
