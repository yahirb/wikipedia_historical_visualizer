{"Fort_Smith": {"Fort Smith Masonic Temple": "The Fort Smith Masonic Temple is a historic building at 200 North 11th Street in Fort Smith, Arkansas. It is a large stone-walled structure, with styling that is an Art Deco-influenced version of Egyptian Revival architecture. Its main (northwest-facing) facade has a projecting central section, from which a series of bays are progressively stepped back, unified by a band of decorative carving at the top, just below the flat roof."}}
