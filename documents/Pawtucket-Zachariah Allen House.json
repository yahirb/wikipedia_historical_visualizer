Built in 1789 by Amos Allen for his brother Zachariah, it is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a central entry and large central chimney. It is a well-preserved example of a transitional Georgian-Federal style house, having retained original siding materials on the outside, and finish woodwork on the interior."}}
