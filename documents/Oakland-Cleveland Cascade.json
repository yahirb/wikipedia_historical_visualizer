{"Oakland": {"Cleveland Cascade": "The Cleveland Cascade is a 250-foot-long ornamental stairway near Lake Merritt in Oakland, California, with cascades in the center, designed in 1923 by Howard Gilkey. It opened with great civic pride as \"one of the few things of this kind in the West\". \nThe Cascade was reportedly modeled after features in the hill towns of Italy."}}
