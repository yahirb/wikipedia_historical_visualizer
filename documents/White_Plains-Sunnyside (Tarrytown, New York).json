{"White_Plains": {"Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)": "Sunnyside (1835) is an historic house on 10 acres (4 ha) along the Hudson River, in Tarrytown, New York. It was the home of the noted American author Washington Irving, best known for his short stories, such as \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819) and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820). This cottage-like estate, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, reflects Dutch Colonial Revival, Scottish Gothic, and Tudor Revival influences, with its instantly recognizable wisteria-covered entrance and jagged crow-stepped gable."}}
