{"Boston": {"Second Brazer Building": "The Second Brazer Building is an historic office building at 25-29 State Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It is a locally significant early Beaux Arts design.\nThe eleven-story skycraper was designed by Cass Gilbert and built in 1897. It is the only work of Gilbert's in Boston, and was built in the same year he won the commission for the Minnesota State Capitol. The building is an early local example of a steel frame structure with curtain walls. It has a trapezoidal plan and is 125 feet in height, with identical fenestration patterns on the northern, eastern, and southern facades. The exterior walls are made of limestone for the first three stories and terra cotta for the upper floors.\nThe tower occupies the site of the first meeting house in Boston, erected in 1632; a plaque on the north facade of the building marks its former location. The land was subsequently acquired in the early nineteenth century by John Brazer, a local merchant, and in 1842 his heirs constructed the first Brazer Building, a three-story Greek Revival structure designed by Isaiah Rogers. The original Brazer building stood on the site until 1896, when it was removed to make way for the current tower.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission on July 9, 1985."}}
