{"Lakewood": {"Playhouse Square": "Playhouse Square is a theater district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. It is the largest performing arts center in the United States outside of New York. (Only Lincoln Center in New York City is larger.) Constructed in a span of 19 months in the early 1920s, the theaters were subsequently closed down, but were revived through a grassroots effort."}}
