{"Chicago": {"Wacker Drive": "Wacker Drive is a major multilevel street in Chicago, Illinois, United States, running along the south side of the main branch and the east side of the south branch of the Chicago River in the Loop. The vast majority of it is double-decked; the upper level intended for local traffic, and the lower level for through-traffic and trucks servicing buildings on the road (and originally a dock). It is sometimes cited as a precursor to the modern freeway, though when it was built the idea was that pleasure vehicles would use the upper level."}}
