{"Whittier": {"Rancho La Habra": "Rancho La Habra (also called \"Rancho Ca\u00f1ada de La Habra\") was a 6,698-acre (27.11 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Los Angeles County and Orange County, California  given in 1839 by Governor Juan Alvarado to Mariano Reyes Roldan. The name refers to the \"Pass Through the Hills\", the natural pass to the north between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills into the San Gabriel Valley, first discovered by Spanish explorers in 1769. The La Habra grant was shaped like a wedge pointed south."}}
