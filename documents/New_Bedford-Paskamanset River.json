The Paskamanset and Slocums River really form just a single river, but the freshwater portion kept its earlier Indian name, while the salt-water portion is named for its English discoverer.\nThe river originates in the Acushnet cedar swamp in New Bedford, and in Sassaquin Pond, also called Myles Pond."}}
