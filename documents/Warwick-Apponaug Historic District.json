{"Warwick": {"Apponaug Historic District": "The Apponaug Historic District is a 2-acre (0.81 ha) residential historic district in the central village of Warwick, Rhode Island, which is also known as Apponaug. It consists of five properties (numbered 3376, 3384, 3387, 3391, 3397-3399, and 3404 Post Rd.) dating to no later than the early 19th century. These houses are a remnant of what was once a much larger collection of period houses in Apponaug, many of which have succumbed to modern 20th-century development of the area."}}
