{"Jackson": {"Congregation Beth Israel (Jackson, Mississippi)": "Congregation Beth Israel (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u200e) is a Reform Jewish congregation located at 5315 Old Canton Road in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. Organized in 1860 by Jews of German background, it has always been, and remains, the only synagogue in Jackson. Beth Israel built the first synagogue in Mississippi in 1867, and, after it burned down, its 1874 replacement was at one time the oldest religious building in Jackson."}}
